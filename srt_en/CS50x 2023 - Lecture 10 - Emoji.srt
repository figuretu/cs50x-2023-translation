00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,490
is the final lecture of CS50.

8
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,170
SPEAKER 1: It's been a tough semester.

9
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,323
We made it through P sets
4, 5, and even finance.

10
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:36,490
SPEAKER 2: Now, I know this
is an unpopular opinion,

11
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,040
but I particularly enjoyed finance.

12
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,560
I spent a lot of time with my flask.

14
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,390

things are looking up.

them for joining us today.

00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:33,790


122
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:38,640
So this is already week 10, our
last, and indeed among the goals

123
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,460
for today are to hopefully give
you all the more of appreciation

124
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,470
of truly just how far you've come.

125
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,380
Recall that in week 0,
we began with this visual

126
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:51,600
here whereby it was described this
class as a bit of a fire hose, whereby

127
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,980
drinking from that fire hose or really
a fire hose from a water fountain

128
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,417
is not unlike getting an
education down the road too.

129
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:01,500
And so this is to say, that if you're
feeling like you didn't quite get it

130
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,480
all down, like that's actually OK.

131
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,590
And that's to be expected.

132
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,170
And even if you felt that with each
passing week, 0, 1, 2 all the way up

133
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,250
now till 10, it never
really ever got easier,

134
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,960
perhaps just consider that what was
once hard like Mario and getting

135
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,600
"Hello, world" to compile
is indeed the right measure

136
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,450
of the delta between week
0 and now in week 10.

137
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:25,770
In fact, you might recall that again
in week 0, 2/3 of your classmates

138
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,180
had never taken a CS course before.

139
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,640
Now, of course, you all have.

140
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,794
And indeed, if you think back to
this final sentiment from week 0,

141
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:34,919
that indeed "what ultimately
matters in this course

142
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,320
is not where you end up
relative to your classmates,

143
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,080
but where you end up relative
to where you yourself began."

144
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,350
So I would take some pride, take
some satisfaction, take some relief,

145
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,100
even though, a little bit more
work does remain at really just how

146
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,810
far you've come since that week 0.

147
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,200
And recall that in week 0, we
literally started with just 0s and 1s.

148
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,580
And by now, many of you might have
gleaned that these 64 0s and 1s have

149
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,410
been spelling something week by week.

150
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,360
In fact, today is our very last message
here in binary encoded on stage.

151
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,490
But then quickly, we
introduced scratch and we

152
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,510
started to assemble some building blocks
of programming, loops, conditions,

153
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,310
loops, conditions,
functions and the like,

154
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,122
but without all the distractions
of semicolons and curly braces

155
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:16,830
and all of that which admittedly
we introduced the next week when

156
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,130
we introduced you to C.

157
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,460
But even now that we've
transitioned to Python,

158
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,068
hopefully even those kinds
of curiosities or confusions

159
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:25,110
are hopefully starting to
just get more familiar.

160
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,230
And so you finally start to see
the missing semicolon as opposed

161
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,210
to spending time on
that kind of struggle.

162
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,480
Recall too, that in week 2, we
started talking already about memory

163
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,120
and how you can manage
things in arrays that later

164
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,920
became, of course, in Python, lists.

165
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,300
The week after we talked not
only about debugging bugs in code

166
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,450
but how to debug those same programs.

167
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,450
Thereafter, we started
talking about algorithms,

168
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,495
and we took a step back
from code and looked

169
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:51,120
at the bubble sorts and the
selection sorts and the merge sorts

170
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,905
and all of the searches as well
that go hand in hand with that.

171
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:57,030
And indeed, this ultimately is what a
lot of problem solving moving forward

172
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,030
is going to be about, just solving
problems with some form of algorithm.

173
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,210
And you have so many different
languages in your toolkit

174
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,370
now with which to approach
problems like those.

175
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,830
We talked thereafter
about pointers, which

176
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,083
are not likely to come back
in any modern languages

177
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,000
that you now use but
hopefully you have an all

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,710
the better of a sense
underneath the hood

179
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,780
of like what's going on
inside of the computer

180
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,120
so that when you're designing
something, you're using something,

181
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,090
something crashes, you at least have
a mental model for what's going on

182
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,810
and it's no longer that week
0 Black box as it once was.

183
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,730
I mean, you built things like this.

184
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,370
Think back to week 5 when you
built your own hash table.

185
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,770
And those things are
everywhere, key value pairs,

186
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:36,720
whether it's in Python or in C or
if it's now in CSS and JavaScript

187
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,960
and even HTML, like that principle of
key value pairs is really everywhere.

188
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,950
And so, of course, now code doesn't
necessarily have to look like this.

189
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,470
It now wonderfully looks a
little something more like this.

190
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,680
But eventually, you're probably not,
I'm not going to use Python anymore.

191
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,810
Something new and better
is going to come along.

192
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,790
But odds are, like a lot
of the building blocks

193
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,480
from these past 11 weeks are still
going to be useful for wrapping

194
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,100
your mind around those new worlds.

195
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,427
And indeed SQL, we introduced
to you a little bit too.

196
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,510
And even if you don't feel
yourself yet an expert,

197
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,820
hopefully you have a sense
of what you can do with it

198
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,500
and what problems you can solve.

199
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,220
It's of course a better alternative to
something simple like a spreadsheet.

200
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,600
And now of course, web
stuff is everywhere,

201
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,062
whether it's on your laptop or desktop
or even a lot of the mobile apps

202
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:19,020
that you use on your
phone, even though they're

203
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,530
native applications, like you install
them from Google Play or the Apple App

204
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,280
Store.

205
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,973
They're implemented increasingly
with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,

206
00:11:26,973 --> 00:11:28,890
but they're put in a
little rectangular window

207
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,770
so you don't even notice that that's
actually really just an embedded

208
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,430
browser.

209
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,397
And then of course,
you can build things,

210
00:11:34,397 --> 00:11:37,230
as you might for your final project,
that too might very well be web

211
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,470
based if you go that route.

212
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,010
I mean, I'm still clinging to
like the very first like web

213
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,840
app I ever made years ago.

214
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,725
But honestly, I do that in part
because I was just so darn proud

215
00:11:46,725 --> 00:11:48,600
that like I taught myself
how to do something

216
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,070
and it actually worked and
was used by other people.

217
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,450
So whether it's just used by you or
your classmates or your roommates

218
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,340
or your family or your
company down the line,

219
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,090
there's a great sense
of satisfaction that

220
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,200
comes despite all of the pain
that might be along the way

221
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,930
when you just can't see or fix that bug.

222
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,760
Now, of course we'll
transition as you'll

223
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,680
see in the coming days to empowering
you to code client side as well.

224
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Up until now, you've been using
our own VS Code installation

225
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,722
in the cloud, which is
nice because you've got up

226
00:12:15,722 --> 00:12:17,730
and running super fast
in week 1, focusing only

227
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,580
on code challenges not on
technical difficulties.

228
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,090
But among the goals now, if you
so choose and want to program

229
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,880
after this class, even if you never
take another CS course before,

230
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,780
you can use these same real
world de facto standard tools

231
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,220
on your own Mac or PC.

232
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,820
And so pictured here is screenshot
of like VS Code on the Mac.

233
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,570
And even though, yes,
you're going to have

234
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,653
to jump through a couple
of more hoops to just get

235
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:41,258
Python or some other language
working on your own Mac or PC,

236
00:12:41,258 --> 00:12:43,800
like that's what programming is
ultimately going to be about.

237
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,450
And we deliberately transition
you to this at term's end

238
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,950
so that now you have 11 weeks
of more comfort under your belt

239
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,680
with which to solve sort
of silly technical support

240
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,570
headaches that might have been
deal breakers so many weeks ago.

241
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,680
So there's still more to be
done in the coming weeks.

242
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,620
And indeed a support structure
therefore, the CS50 hackathon,

243
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,220
of course, will be this
7:00 PM till 7:00 AM

244
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,380
opportunity to dive into
your final project--

245
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,530
well, really continue diving
into your final project ideally

246
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,040
at that point alongside classmates,
perhaps your project partners

247
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,630
if you're working collaboratively.

248
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:19,593
And awaiting you will be such memories
and excitement hopefully as these,

249
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:22,260
even as you then turn your attention
back to your final project.

250
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,160
There of course, will be several meals
during the day culminating with 5:00 AM

251
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,160
shuttles to IHOP, the
local pancake place,

252
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,010
if you are so awake at that
point or even if you get there.

253
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,970
This is not an uncommon sight
as you might recall from week 0.

254
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,520
And then lastly is the
CS50 fair, which is finally

255
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,247
back after a couple of years
now of it not being on campus.

256
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,080
And this will be an
opportunity for everyone

257
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,873
to present their final
projects to passers by,

258
00:13:45,873 --> 00:13:48,540
classmates, faculty and staff and
really just delight in what it

259
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,520
is you created on your Mac, your PC,
your phone, in the cloud or anywhere

260
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,020
else.

261
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,630
And indeed, it's just
going to be an opportunity

262
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,060
to bring your laptop to a
shared space or your phone

263
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,750
and introduce your project to
passers by such as might appear

264
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,870
and ultimately celebrate
what you all accomplished.

265
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,710
And indeed will you be handed at
the CS50 fair, your very own I took

266
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:12,490
CS50 t-shirt, which I daresay, I'm
still wearing all of these years later.

267
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,605
And so you too--

268
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:15,600
[APPLAUSE]

269
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,240
--will have that ahead of you as well.

270
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,010
So for what's on the agenda today, we
thought we would not only look back

271
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:23,757
but look forward.

272
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:26,340
But first, we wanted to thank
so many of the team members that

273
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,500
have been helping both
on stage and off who've

274
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,370
made this course and these sections
and so much more about CS50 possible.

275
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,590
Of course, the building
that we are now in,

276
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,410
there's a whole team downstairs
in Memorial Hall who helps

277
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,240
us get set up and organized each day.

278
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,230
Our thanks to them.

279
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,350
There's the education support services
team who makes everything look

280
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,140
and sound so well down here,
especially when we have all of them

281
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,820
more microphones as well.

282
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,310
Our friends, the Harvard
Krokodiloes and the Radcliffe

283
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:55,890
Pitches most recently and then of
course CS50's own team, that [INAUDIBLE]

284
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,130
CS50's own favorite restaurant,
Chang Chau, down the road.

285
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,340
Indeed if you find yourself in
Cambridge for the next 1, 2, 3, 4 years

286
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,160
or visiting from out of town,
do pay a visit to our friends

287
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,090
just down the road.

288
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,060
And in fact, we'll have our
very last CS50 lunch this Friday

289
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,130
if you're able locally to partake.

290
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,790
And then there are CS50's own
team, both on stage and off.

291
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,780
And my thanks, truly.

292
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,540
Because not only do they make
everything run so smoothly,

293
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,960
they capture it for students here who
might not be physically present here.

294
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,900
For our friends down in New Haven
at Yale and certainly for anyone

295
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,100
online who might be tuning in as well.

296
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,220
And then lastly, wanted
to thank, of course,

297
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,240
the huge team of your
classmates, your peers that

298
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,230
make CS50 possible in sections and
office hours, tutorials, and more.

299
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,980
Allow me to share with
you the outtakes, so

300
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,520
that even we, the teaching staff
sometimes struggle with computer

301
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,910
science, here are some of the clips
that we captured when just passing

302
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,340
packets via TCPIP a while back.

303
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,540
You saw the finally--

304
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,240
the nicely polished
version, but here are,

305
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,585
if I may, if we could dim the
lights, are some of the outtakes.

306
00:15:57,585 --> 00:16:00,510
[MUSIC PLAYING]

307
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,110
Buffering.

308
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,330
OK.

309
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,450
Josh, nice.

310
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,300
Helen, Oh.

311
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:13,845
[CHUCKLES] Yet, Moni, No, oh, wait.

312
00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:19,872


313
00:16:19,872 --> 00:16:20,830
That was amazing, Josh.

314
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,790


315
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,326
But.

316
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:26,025
Um, Sophie.

317
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:33,210


318
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,730
Amazing.

319
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,850
That was perfect.

320
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,870
Moni.

321
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,240
[CHUCKLES] I think I--

322
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,880
SPEAKER 4: Hey, un-mute.

323
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,403
DAVID J. MALAN: Over to Yoel.

324
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:47,320
SPEAKER 4: [INAUDIBLE]

325
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,153
DAVID J. MALAN: Guy.

326
00:16:48,153 --> 00:16:51,980


327
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,090
That was amazing.

328
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:53,788
Thank you all.

329
00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:54,580
SPEAKER 4: So good.

330
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,568


331
00:16:56,568 --> 00:16:59,360
DAVID J. MALAN: Indeed, in that
moment, if we could, just one round

332
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,790
of applause for everyone who's
helped out this semester.

333
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:06,030
[APPLAUSE]

334
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:11,319
So back in week 0, we
introduced you, of course,

335
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,920
to this idea of
computational thinking, which

336
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,858
is to think a little more methodically,
a little more algorithmically.

337
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:18,868
And by way of these various
languages, hopefully, that

338
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:20,949
is something you notice,
maybe not in the moment,

339
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,000
but in the months and the years to come
that you do find that your thoughts are

340
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
indeed a little more cleaned up and
you're just able to express yourself

341
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,630
a little more precisely and even spot
illogic in someone else's document

342
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,760
or statements as well.

343
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,510
But at the end of the
day, really a course

344
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,580
like this is also about
critical thinking.

345
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,010
And indeed, rewind
again to week 0 when we

346
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,850
frame the entirety of computer science
as really just this, problem solving.

347
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,120
And any problem in the world, be
it CS or otherwise, has some input,

348
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,130
and we decided how to
represent those inputs.

349
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,320
It needs some output,
the solution there too.

350
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,620
And then all of what you focused
on doing and learning and applying

351
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,220
these past several weeks is in that
proverbial black box, which hopefully

352
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,670
is not such an abstraction
anymore but is indeed something

353
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,495
that you know how to harness
and know what could be going on

354
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:05,370
underneath the hood, even if it's
in some technology or some language

355
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,000
that maybe we ourselves didn't cover,
because a lot of those first principles

356
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,150
remain the same.

357
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,840
Now, along the way, we talked about the
quality of solutions to those problems.

358
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,200
We happen to focus on
correctness, just does it work?

359
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,110
Design, which is a bit more
qualitative and subjective.

360
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,000
And then style, the
aesthetics of it all.

361
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,980
And these two are
characteristic, maybe not

362
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,040
with these same words, of just
how you might write or evaluate

363
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,590
other creations in life, be it
physical or written or the like.

364
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,500
So think about too,
as you solve problems,

365
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,920
just how you can frame for
yourself, like am I doing a good job

366
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,520
or not by quantizing it, along these
or perhaps other axises as well.

367
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,540
And we thought we'd highlight just
two topics from that week 0 that

368
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,780
have really been manifest for the past
several weeks, namely abstraction,

369
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,440
like taking complicated things and ideas
and trying to simplify them so that we

370
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,500
can operate at this level and
solve problems we care about

371
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,790
without getting into the weeds of
implementation details so to speak.

372
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,100
But there's this tension
because, you know now,

373
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,850
from all of these different languages,
that code is fairly unforgiving.

374
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,980
I mean, even omitting a stupid
semicolon sometimes breaks everything.

375
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,310
And so precision is sort
of at odds sometimes

376
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,900
with this idea of
leveraging abstraction.

377
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,890
And so we thought we would
try to tease this apart,

378
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:19,210
especially all these weeks later here,
but with a bit of a live demonstration.

379
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,930
So on the way in, you probably
all received a sheet of paper.

380
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,780
If not, but someone near you
did just tear theirs in half

381
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,940
and borrow half a sheet
if you can or any piece

382
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,310
of loose leaf paper or
the like will suffice

383
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,260
as long as you have a pen or pencil.

384
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:37,230
And for this, allow me to propose
that we invite up maybe two final CS50

385
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,795
volunteers this semester, and like
a lot of hands are going up in this.

386
00:19:41,795 --> 00:19:42,420
A lot of hands.

387
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,730
How about, I saw the first hand there.

388
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,280
Yes, who's pointing at herself now.

389
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,190
Come on down.

390
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,980
We just need the one hand
for now but, oh, wait.

391
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,183
You'll be our number two.

392
00:19:54,183 --> 00:19:56,100
Well, OK, we have way
too many volunteers now.

393
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,760
No, no please.

394
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,480
Please come down.

395
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,260
Yes, in the black shirt.

396
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,890
And if you guys, we will, we'll
do pair programming in just a bit.

397
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,640
If you want to hang
out in the wings here,

398
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,630
we'll have our second
demonstration as well.

399
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,380
So OK, now maybe round of
applause for our three volunteers.

400
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,555
[APPLAUSE]

401
00:20:12,555 --> 00:20:14,440


402
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:14,940
Oh.

403
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,870
Come on up, first.

404
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,920
Oh, no.

405
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,880
Second and third.

406
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,750
OK, you come first.

407
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,310
We'll do it order No.

408
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,570
This is a queue.

409
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,362
Queue here.

410
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:23,070
What's your name?

411
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,580
DANI: I'm Dani.

412
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,000
DAVID J. MALAN: Dani.

413
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,810
OK, take this mic.

414
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,723
OK, so we will de-queue you momentarily.

415
00:20:27,723 --> 00:20:29,890
All right, so Dani, come
on over to the middle here.

416
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,630
And in a moment, I'm going to
hand to Dani a sheet of paper that

417
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,562
has a picture on it.

418
00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:36,270
And this picture is
going to be something

419
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,870
that I'd like you to verbally
program the audience to draw.

420
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,380
You can use any words, any abstractions,
any level of precision that you want,

421
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,700
but you just can't make hand gestures
or sort of show them what to draw.

422
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,000
But first, you want to tell us a little
something about yourself, including

423
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,840
everyone here.

424
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,288
DANI: I'm Dani, and I took CS50.

425
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:55,080
DAVID J. MALAN: OK.

426
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,830
Wonderful.

427
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,400
Wonderful.

428
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,468
So I'm going to reveal
the picture only to Dani.

429
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:02,010
And if each of you would like
to take out that sheet of paper

430
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,470
and just make sure that
no one else can see this,

431
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,540
if you want to hold it up this way.

432
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,500
Everyone here is now holding their pen
or pencil, and in some number of steps,

433
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,757
give them a verbal algorithm
for drawing what you see.

434
00:21:12,757 --> 00:21:15,090
And you can say anything you
want, but no hand gestures.

435
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,780
DANI: OK, so you're
going to want to draw

436
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:26,010
a square in the center of the
paper with the diagonal pointing

437
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,160
to the center of the edge.

438
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,750


439
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,300
Wait.

440
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,670
No actually, scratch that.

441
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,595
Draw a rhombus in the
center of your paper.

442
00:21:38,595 --> 00:21:41,450


443
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,120
DAVID J. MALAN: And for those
who forget what a rhombus is?

444
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,484
DANI: A diamond.

445
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:51,020
A square that's on its side.

446
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:56,700
And then from the bottom vertex,
draw a straight line down,

447
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,060
but not all the way to
the edge of the paper.

448
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,960


449
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,690
OK.

450
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:06,580
And then keep your pencil
or pen at that point,

451
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,940
and you're going to want
to draw a line that's

452
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,845
parallel to the line of the
original rhombus to the right.

453
00:22:14,845 --> 00:22:18,320


454
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,370
And then keep your pencil
or pen at that point,

455
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,790
and draw a line straight up,
connecting to the side vertex.

456
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:28,840


457
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,410
Yes.

458
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:34,450
And then go back to the line that
you drew from the bottom vertex

459
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:39,070
to the bottom of the paper,
and then draw a line parallel

460
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,840
to the left edge of the rhombus.

461
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,510
And then keep your pencil at
that point and draw a line up

462
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,585
to the vertex of the rhombus again.

463
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:55,990


464
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,990
DAVID J. MALAN: The end.

465
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:57,440
DANI: The end.

466
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,040
DAVID J. MALAN: All right.

467
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,270
Well, thank you to Dani.

468
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,290
Hang on to your paper.

469
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,295
Thank you so much.

470
00:23:01,295 --> 00:23:03,920
And if you want to step off to
the stage there, we will reveal.

471
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,520
Thank you.

472
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,395
A round of applause
if we could for Dani.

473
00:23:06,395 --> 00:23:07,100
[APPLAUSE]

474
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,260
That is not an easy task, I'm sure.

475
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,328
And if Carter wouldn't mind just
grabbing a few samples here,

476
00:23:13,328 --> 00:23:15,620
let's actually take a look
on the overhead if we could.

477
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,330
I'm going to pop down
over here real fast.

478
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,330
We don't need to collect
them all, but if you're

479
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:25,370
feeling either good or bad with what you
drew, happy to collect a few of them.

480
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,930
OK.

481
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:27,590
Thank you.

482
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,860
Thank you.

483
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,940
I hope you won't mind if
I can't reach everyone.

484
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,400
Just a couple more, over here.

485
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,000
OK.

486
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,830
All right, that's--

487
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,575
OK.

488
00:23:37,575 --> 00:23:39,200
AUDIENCE: This one's really [INAUDIBLE]

489
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,250
DAVID J. MALAN: This one's really funny.

490
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,480
I'm going to go with this one if I may.

491
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,530
And Carter has some too.

492
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:48,050


493
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,520
Thank you so much.

494
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,090
OK.

495
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,910
So just a random assortment here.

496
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,300
Let me turn on a camera so
I can show you what I see.

497
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,740
Here, for instance, is
one classmate's drawing

498
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,280
which might resemble
perhaps what you Drew here.

499
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,530
Here is the beginnings
of a house, it seems.

500
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,850
Nice.

501
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,920
This one, this one is larger.

502
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,630
And how about a couple of others
that were getting closer, I think.

503
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,970
So more edges and vertices there.

504
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:30,080
This one seems a little similar
in spirit, if not proportional.

505
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,310
This is Zac's the best one.

506
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,790
But it turns out if I may, Zac,
you're not all that far off.

507
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,960
Here, Dani, is what you were
reciting to everyone algorithmically.

508
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,000
Indeed, it was this here cube.

509
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,240
And so Dani, can you come
on back up for a moment.

510
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,448
So if you'd like to share
for just a moment like what

511
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,490
were some of the thoughts
going through your head

512
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,870
and why did you choose
the words that you did?

513
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,620
DANI: OK.

514
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,250
So what was going through
my head when I saw the cube.

515
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,580
I didn't know if I
could say, draw a cube.

516
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,490
So I decided to start
with the top and so

517
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,590
draw a rhombus in the
center of your paper,

518
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:11,640
and then draw a line down
and just do the first part.

519
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,420
Then the second part,
then the third part.

520
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,280
And then you would get a cube like Zac.

521
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,200
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah,
and so had you said,

522
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,597
and you could have said, draw a cube,
which would be more of an abstraction.

523
00:25:21,597 --> 00:25:23,930
Even that's not necessarily
sufficiently precise, right,

524
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,778
because you don't necessarily know
what the orientation of that cube

525
00:25:26,778 --> 00:25:28,820
is, the size of it, the
positioning on the paper.

526
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,640
So you instead took a lower level
approach, which is not unlike Scratch.

527
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,723
If you think about Scratch,
being able to move up,

528
00:25:33,723 --> 00:25:36,710
down, left, right, turn 90 degrees,
turn 15 degrees and the like.

529
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,890
I mean, that is ultimately how a
lot of graphical programs and games

530
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,680
even might be implemented by really
focusing at the level you do.

531
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,763
But of course, there's
this tension with us humans

532
00:25:44,763 --> 00:25:46,820
whereby we prefer often
to think at this level,

533
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,403
but even that might not be sufficient.

534
00:25:48,403 --> 00:25:50,660
Which is to say, here in
week 10, these are still

535
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,990
going to be in our hard problems,
but a hand, if we could,

536
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,960
one more time for Dani for
getting us that far along.

537
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,710
Thank you so much.

538
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,168
Let me give you a stress ball here.

539
00:25:59,168 --> 00:25:59,750
[APPLAUSE]

540
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,440
All right.

541
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,730
And if we could have both of
our volunteers come up here.

542
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,490
We're going to have-- yes, come on up.

543
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,240
Come on up.

544
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,220
And let me have you guys introduce
yourselves in the middle here.

545
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,132
EVAN: Hi, I'm Evan.

546
00:26:15,132 --> 00:26:15,840
SADDIQ: Hi there.

547
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,970
I'm Saddiq from Turkey.

548
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:17,660
Nice to meet you all.

549
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,230
DAVID J. MALAN: Wonderful.

550
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,890
Welcome.

551
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:23,450
And this time we're going to flip
it around so as to have the audience

552
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,400
do what Dani just did for us.

553
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,440
The only catch here
is that the only means

554
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,755
we have for showing the audience
what they need to tell you to draw

555
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,630
is like literally right
above the chalkboard.

556
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,110
So on our system here, that your
eyes must stay on the chalkboard

557
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,160
and not look up.

558
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,740
And in just a moment, if
you guys want to both stand

559
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,320
in front of the chalkboard,
back to the audience.

560
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,740
And as you're talking with each other,
verbalize it through the microphone

561
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,470
if you will.

562
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,610
I'm going to show everyone else in
the room a second and final drawing,

563
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,740
and we'll just go rapid
fire around the room,

564
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,870
give us one step at a time
collectively, and we'll

565
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:57,595
see if these guys can't draw
exactly that same outcome.

566
00:26:57,595 --> 00:26:58,970
AUDIENCE: Is there another chalk?

567
00:26:58,970 --> 00:26:59,510
DAVID J. MALAN: What's that?

568
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,830
SADDIQ: Is there another chalk?

569
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,705
DAVID J. MALAN: Just the one, so
you'll have to collaborate and let's

570
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:08,660
give you a clean slate here, literally.

571
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,290
All right.

572
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,280
So no looking up.

573
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,920
That's the only rule for you guys.

574
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,550
Here we go.

575
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:20,030
For the audience, here is what we'd
like them, ironically, to draw.

576
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,430
Step one, from anyone in the audience?

577
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,050
Yes.

578
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,710

DAVID J. MALAN: Draw a circle.

580
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,210
Anywhere.

581
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,980

DAVID J. MALAN: OK.

584
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,080
That's step one.

585
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,010
Step two.

586
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:37,830
Someone else?

00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,006
Yeah, in the middle.

from the bottom of the stairs,

589
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,450
about halfway down to the--

00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,033
half way down.

00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:47,033
DAVID J. MALAN: Draw a
line down from the bottom

592
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,680
of the circle about halfway down.

00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,555
I think there was a hand
in front of you too.

00:27:50,555 --> 00:27:52,064
Number three?

595
00:27:52,064 --> 00:27:57,720
AUDIENCE: From the point on the bottom,
draw a diagonal line to the left.

596
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,220

DAVID J. MALAN: The overarching
goal here, for those unable to hear,

602
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,170
is to draw a person.

603
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,535

00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:12,035
SADDIQ: OK.

605
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:13,260
It may be a stick figure.

606

DAVID J. MALAN: Draw the left leg
of the person, of this person.

608
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,050
OK.

609
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:19,560
Good job.

Yeah?

614
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:28,021
AUDIENCE: Go to the vertice of
the line going up and the circle

615
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:32,632
and to the left, I'm sorry,
to the right, draw a V.

616
00:28:32,632 --> 00:28:35,590
DAVID J. MALAN: To the right of the
vertex at the bottom of the circle,

00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,510
draw a V.

618
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,290

DAVID J. MALAN: Nope, not interactive.

622
00:28:41,813 --> 00:28:44,110
Draw a V.

00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:32,620
Nice.

685
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,360
12.

686
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,470
Do we want to give them one more?

687
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:37,970
12?

688
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,440
Or are we good?

689
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,420
Yeah, last one.

690
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,290
AUDIENCE: Erase the right arm.

691
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,300
DAVID J. MALAN: Erase the right arm.

692
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,330
I think we're going to need a 13 then.

693
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:51,260
And then?

694
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,188
Yeah?

695
00:30:52,188 --> 00:30:54,532
AUDIENCE: Repeat the left
arm, but rotate it 90 degrees.

696
00:30:54,532 --> 00:30:57,240
DAVID J. MALAN: Repeat the left
arm, but rotate it by 90 degrees.

697
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,903


698
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:01,945
SADDIQ: That feels wrong.

699
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,850


700
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:05,780
How would you like--

701
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,950
as an organic human being,
how would you use your arms?

702
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:07,060
DAVID J. MALAN: No.

703
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,560
No.

704
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,460
No.

705
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,357
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

706
00:31:10,357 --> 00:31:12,440
SADDIQ: Would you ever
stretch your arm like that?

707
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,482
DAVID J. MALAN: That would
not be a stick figure.

708
00:31:14,482 --> 00:31:16,550


709
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:19,190
SADDIQ: Would you do this
or would you do that?

710
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,620
DAVID J. MALAN: All
right, little hint, maybe.

711
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,420
Give me a step 14.

712
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,710
Step 14 and final?

713
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,250
Step 14?

714
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,368


715
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:29,160
I think we just got to
tell him what to do.

716
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,390
Step 14?

717
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,230
Yes?

718
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,090
AUDIENCE: Think of a walking man.

719
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:38,980
The right hand [INAUDIBLE]
normal [INAUDIBLE],, but just

720
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,440
rotate the edge of it
a little to a left.

721
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,230
DAVID J. MALAN: Think of a
walking man, and have the left,

722
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:51,238
the right hand walking to your right.

723
00:31:51,238 --> 00:31:52,030
SADDIQ: It's like--

724
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,220
DAVID J. MALAN: Where could the hand go?

725
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,610
Where should the hand go on that arm?

726
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,690
But Yeah.

727
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,190
OK.

728
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:00,730
Yes.

729
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:03,400
No.

730
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,720
I mean, look right here.

731
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,440
Look right here.

732
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,520
Look right.

733
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,420
Yes, sorry.

734
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,740
Thank you.

735
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,200
14 is done.

736
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,550
[APPLAUSE]

737
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:15,650
That's pretty close, so
congratulations to you guys.

738
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,150
And thank you as well.

739
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:20,620
All right, so I mean, these
things too are not-- yes, round

740
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,030
of applause then, sure.

741
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,630
[APPLAUSE]

742
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:30,400
So this is to say these ideas
of abstraction and precision

743
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,650
and really every other term
of art that we explored

744
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,630
this term are sort of
omnipresent and can

745
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,700
be easier or harder
to implement depending

746
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,560
on exactly what the problem is.

747
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,620
But what we thought we'd
do now in our final day

748
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,520
is try to now similarly prepare
you for life after CS50.

749
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,200
And this is really going to be a
list of really potential to-do,

750
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,140
so that you can stand on your own
after the class, after the classes'

751
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,240
infrastructure, write actual code.

752
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,030
And then we'll come full circle
one final time with our friend

753
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,460
Jennifer 8 Lee to look
at the world of emojis

754
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,190
and how they relate to all
forms of representation

755
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,960
that we've talked about up until now.

756
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,100
So one, how can you go about
programming after CS50?

757
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,390
So one, you can actually install command
line tools on your own Mac or PC.

758
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,550
Perhaps unbeknownst to
you, Windows has what's

759
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,990
generally called a command prompt.

760
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,380
Mac OS literally comes with a terminal
program in your applications utilities

761
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:21,880
folder.

762
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,838
And so even if you've
never run those programs,

763
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:26,050
you've actually had a
sort of blinking cursor,

764
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,940
black and white prompt available to you.

765
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,210
Might not have all of the same
software installed as your code space

766
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,880
in the cloud, but you have that
command line interface even

767
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,500
within today's graphical tools.

768
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,980
And among the tools you can install
within that command line interface

769
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,080
would be something
called Xcode on the Mac

770
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,740
which comes not only with a GUI IDE,
integrated development environment,

771
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,710
but also those command line
tools and Microsoft for Windows

772
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,510
has something similar as well.

773
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:53,177
Learning Git, so we've used
Git, only unbeknownst to you

774
00:33:53,177 --> 00:33:54,760
underneath the hood for the most part.

775
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,240
But Git is a very, very
popular tool, if challenging

776
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,060
to pick up for the first time,
that makes it easy to push code

777
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,550
to a website called
GitHub or any equivalent

778
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,800
and then collaborate more
effectively with classmates.

779
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,675
There's definitely a
bit of a learning curve,

780
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:10,270
but thanks to CS50's own Brian
Yu, you can start, for instance

781
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,380
with a video like this.

782
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,780
And this indeed is going to be
one of these de facto standards

783
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,040
in the real world, at least
for the next several years

784
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,750
that you'll probably encounter if you
work in tech or really any company

785
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,250
where you're doing some programming.

786
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,320
VS code itself, we'll walk you through
this process in the coming days,

787
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,860
but you can indeed install
it on your own Mac or PC.

788
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,790
And what can you do when you write code?

789
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:31,870
Well, you can certainly write
software for your Mac, for your PC,

790
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:35,199
for your phone, or of
course per week 9, you

791
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:41,830
can host your own website be it
static as in week 8, hosting it

792
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,550
at websites like these, which generally
have free or student-friendly accounts

793
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,639
via which you can put something
statically on the web at a real domain

794
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,199
name that you might choose.

795
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:53,320
Or you can host a full
fledged web app, and using

796
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,210
student tiers on Amazon and Microsoft
and Google's Cloud Services or others,

797
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,150
you can sign up for, being a
student certainly, a whole lot

798
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:06,670
of free software, free hosting so as to
if nothing else experiment and perhaps

799
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,530
maximally get your own app
or website up and running.

800
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,690
So know that those are
resources available to you.

801
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,340
And this is by certainly
a non-exhaustive list.

802
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,400
If you'd like to geek out in the
coming months, in the coming years,

803
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,210
these are just some of the places
that people who take computer science

804
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:25,570
classes, who write code, might
tend to hang out and ask and answer

805
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,230
questions of each other.

806
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,290
So keep an eye for
instance on these here.

807
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,840
And then CS50 has its own
communities as you'll see.

808
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,020
If you go to this URL here via
the OpenCourseWare version of CS50

809
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,710
which is open to the world,
there a vibrant community,

810
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:42,280
thanks to time zones, that's
pretty much active 24/7, 365.

811
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,470
Talking about not only CS50 goings
on and problem sets and projects,

812
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,020
but really technology
more generally, as well.

813
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,090
So certainly feel welcome to partake,
either asking or answering questions.

814
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,540
Now, speaking of asking and answering
questions, a couple of weeks

815
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,900
ago, you kindly gave us a
whole bunch of review questions

816
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,558
which we culled through and picked
out our favorite 20 of them.

817
00:36:02,558 --> 00:36:04,600
These, of course, were
multiple choice questions.

818
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,590
And in preparation for this
week, in preparation for life

819
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:12,580
ahead, we thought we would
choreograph a bit of a quiz show here.

820
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,670
And indeed, as you came
in at the start of class,

821
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:20,350
you might recall being invited to go
to this URL here, CS50/ly, either here

822
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:25,240
in person or if you're watching
live from home at this URL here.

823
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,030
You can use a phone or a laptop.

824
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,500
And if it's easier on the phone, you
can point your camera at this 2D barcode

825
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,470
here, we'll give folks a
moment to pull that up.

826
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:46,560
And again that, URL was CS50.ly/poll,
and once it looks like most folks have

827
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:54,150
it up and running, our friend Carter
here will help us dive into this review

828
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,300
session, if you will, with
a bit of fun along the way.

829
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,790
All right, Carter, if
you'd like to take it away.

830
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,950
What do we have as our first question?

831
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,920
You should see on your phone or
laptop, this same question being asked.

832
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,560
The first question is, "How do
you print quote, unquote "hello,

833
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,540
world" in Python?"

834
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:14,600
So among the possible
answers are these here.

835
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,705
Buzz in on your phone or your laptop.

836
00:37:16,705 --> 00:37:19,840


837
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,040
We've got a few hundred
responses already.

838
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,930
Seven seconds to make your decision.

839
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,790


840
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,790
This is question 1 of 20, going
into it with some confidence.

841
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:36,490
I think we're down to 0 on the clock
and Carter it looks like 98% of you

842
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,960
indeed said, "hello, world."

843
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,660
And Carter, per the check mark,
that's indeed the correct answer here.

844
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,670
Now, to make things interesting, know
that you'll see some number of points.

845
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:49,210
And we've deliberately anonymized
it so only what number you are.

846
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:53,320
So a whole lot of guests have a
perfect score of 1,000 at the moment.

847
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,610
Hopefully we'll see over
the next several questions,

848
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,460
things start to bridge out.

849
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,460
But know that the speed
with which you buzz in

850
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,220
will also factor into how
many points you now get.

851
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,830
So the faster you move,
the more points you get.

852
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:09,885
Question 2, if we could,
"What does DNS stand for?"

853
00:38:09,885 --> 00:38:11,260
from just a couple of weeks back.

854
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,550
"Domain Number System.

855
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,020
Domain Name System.

856
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:19,860
Data Numbering Structure" and
"There's no such thing as DNS."

857
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:26,640
Few hundred responses
are in, 8 seconds remain.

858
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,580
Fewer points now, but
still a chance to buzz in.

859
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:34,560
And now as we hit zero, the responses
are these, "Domain Name System" which

860
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,360
is indeed correct, and 84% of you got
that one correctly, and indeed exists,

861
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,590
we talked about it a
couple of weeks ago.

862
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,112
So we're still seeing a
whole lot of ties at 2,000.

863
00:38:44,112 --> 00:38:46,320
We'll see if someone starts
to pull away before long.

864
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,220
Question three, "What is the upper
bound of Merge Sort's run time?"

865
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,460
So that escalated quickly.

866
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,500
"Big O of n log n.

867
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,560
Big O of log n.

868
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,240
Omega of log n."

869
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,190
or "Big O of 1."

870
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:07,420
"What is the upper bound
of Merge Sort's runtime?"

871
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,020
That was the last of the algorithms
we saw for sorting, and in one second,

872
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,170
we'll see that the correct
answer is just edging out

873
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:18,010
everyone else, indeed, 46% it is, n--

874
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:18,880
I know.

875
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,590
It's n log n.

876
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:24,280
Now, if I may, as the
teacher, it can't be log n,

877
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,290
because log n is strictly less than n.

878
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:29,710
And you can't possibly sort n
elements unless you minimally look at

879
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,950
or touch each of them.

880
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,550
So it's got to be at least
greater than n intuitively.

881
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,050
We still have a whole bunch of ties.

882
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,660
Let's move on to number 4.

883
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,930
"What is stored in argc?"

884
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,240
Back to the language, C. Is
it "An array of arguments.

885
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,920
The maximum size of an array.

886
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,860
The count of arguments given
to a program when first run."

887
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,630
or "how much memory is
allocated to a function?"

888
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,850
Again, you wrote all of these questions.

889
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:59,290
And we have 5 seconds, for the reveal.

890
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:05,500
Argc is indeed "The count of arguments
given to a program when first run."

891
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,450
Think back to C when we did command
line arguments, there was argc and argv.

892
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,510
Argv was the array, but
argc was indeed the count.

893
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,770
The a and argc.

894
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:18,550
All right, we still have a
whole bunch of ties at the top

895
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,430
here, but let's move
on then to number 5.

896
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,550
"What is the duck
debugger's favorite hobby?"

897
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,940
According to one of your classmates,
"Dressing up like Dracula.

898
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,320
Swimming across the stage.

899
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,560
Filling up the entire
bathroom of a guy's house.

900
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,430
Sitting quietly on stage."

901
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,680
The third of course, is a
reference to a YouTube video

902
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,150
that was on the course's
website that week.

903
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:46,720
But according to your classmates,
number 2, seconds remaining,

904
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,650
sitting quietly on stage
is its favorite pastime.

905
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:54,610
So a little harder
perhaps than the others.

906
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:57,400
5,000, now we're starting
to see some spread.

907
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,480
So we only have six guests in
contention for first place.

908
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:08,120
And the next question now is 6, "What is
the function used to open a file in C?"

909
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,220
"fopen.

910
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,545
open. fileopen.

911
00:41:10,545 --> 00:41:11,045
file."

912
00:41:11,045 --> 00:41:13,870


913
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,840
"What is the function
used to open a file in C?"

914
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,390


915
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:23,440
7 seconds.

916
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,660
There's some differences between
C and Python here, and the reveal,

917
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,710
it is indeed fopen at 77% correct too.

918
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,390
All right, let's see the rankings now.

919
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:41,680
If you are Guest1590, 715, 6171,
3753 or 3273, you're now in the lead

920
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,410
as we move on to question 7.

921
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,020
"How does strlen compute the avg--

922
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:51,150
sorry, how does strlen compute
the length of a string in C?"

923
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,070
"It looks at how much
memory the string uses.

924
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,862
It counts the number of characters
until it reaches backslash zero.

925
00:41:55,862 --> 00:41:57,870
It counts the number
of bits in the string.

926
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:02,000
It creates pointers for each
character and counts them."

927
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,900
10 seconds, strlen in C. Recall that
we implemented this ourselves in class,

928
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,000
but then we use the library thereafter.

929
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,200
And indeed, with 85%, it simply
counts the number of characters

930
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,260
until it reaches that sentinel,
backslash zero, a.k.a.

931
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:19,960
Null.

932
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:27,580
And in this case, we have 544
of you tied now for first.

933
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:32,870
All right, question 8, "Where
does malloc allocate memory from?"

934
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:33,590
The "Stack."

935
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:38,650
The "Heap" The "Pointers" or
the "Temp" "Where does malloc

936
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,150
allocate memory from?"

937
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,690


938
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,825
Responses are coming in, 8 seconds.

939
00:42:44,825 --> 00:42:48,280


940
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,470
A good review question at that.

941
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:54,670
In 2 seconds we'll see that malloc
allocates memory from, close one,

942
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,800
the Heap is correct.

943
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,760
The Heap is correct.

944
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,102
The stack recall is
where functions store

945
00:43:00,102 --> 00:43:01,810
their local variables
and their arguments

946
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,440
and that just happens automatically.

947
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,690
The Heap represented in our pictures
up top is where malloc draws from.

948
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:15,430
Now we have guest 15 has
made its way to the top here,

949
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:18,130
but others can catch up if
they don't buzz in fast enough.

950
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:21,520
So number 9, "How many
people flew from Fiftyville

951
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,660
to New York on the day of the crime?"

952
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,590
"16.

953
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:27,550
29.

954
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,930
8."

955
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:29,740
or "3."

956
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:33,190


957
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,920
Anyone with a laptop perhaps
has an advantage here.

958
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,590


959
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:46,200
5 seconds, and the answers are--

960
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,240
but the answer is 16.

961
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,830


962
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:54,090
Let's see if Guest15 got this.

963
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,220
They did not.

964
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,200
Goodbye to Guest15 at the top.

965
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,490
All right, question 10.

966
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:00,900
We're about halfway there.

967
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:06,720
"What are meta tags used for in
HTML? " "To describe a web page.

968
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,700
To define parameters for an element.

969
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,960
To group elements together.

970
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,040
To translate content into
machine-readable format."

971
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,830
"What are meta tags used for in HTML?"

972
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:24,200
We saw a few of them
for different use cases.

973
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,490
And with 1 second, we see that
indeed the number one answer

974
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:31,590
was to describe the webpage,
be it for a mobile device,

975
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:34,460
be it for screen scrapers
like Facebook and Twitter

976
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,830
and other such apps that grab
images and descriptions thereof.

977
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:38,330
All right.

978
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:44,870
We're in the second half
now, Guest4669 edged ahead.

979
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,710
Guest15 is now in sixth place.

980
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:47,210
All right.

981
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:51,730
Number 11 is "How do you find
the address of a variable in C?"

982
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,140
Think back a few weeks.

983
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,200
Star, dollar sign, ampersand Ask.

984
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,470


985
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:03,630
From one of your own
classmates, "How do you

986
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,640
find the address of a variable in C?"

987
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:11,350


988
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:15,010
And the number one answer
is ampersand which is indeed

989
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:17,470
the address of operator at 62%.

990
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:18,250
Nicely done.

991
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,620
Let's see who's the top of the list now.

992
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:25,060
Guest4669 has retained their
lead, so we move on to 12.

993
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,990
"What does the arrow
operator mean in C?"

994
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:31,210
A hyphen and a greater than sign.

995
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:31,990
"Nothing.

996
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,100
Starts a comment.

997
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,080
Replaces a star in dot operator.

998
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,220
Declares a pointer."

999
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:43,360
"What does this arrow
operator mean in C?"

1000
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,000
Again from a few weeks back.

1001
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,750
3 seconds, harder assortment perhaps.

1002
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:54,430
And it's oh, "Replaces
a star in dot operator."

1003
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:57,010
The number two answer
was indeed correct.

1004
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,770
This was just a cleaner
way, syntactic sugar

1005
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,860
for collapsing what would be a star
and then some parentheses and then a

1006
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,950
dot into quite simply something
that looks like an arrow itself.

1007
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,470
All right, Carter,
who's in the lead now?

1008
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:12,910
Still that same guest, and
let's see what 13 has for us.

1009
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:16,390
"Which of these is not
a data type in SQLite?"

1010
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:17,440
"BLOB.

1011
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,595
STRING, INTEGER.

1012
00:46:19,595 --> 00:46:20,095
TEXT."

1013
00:46:20,095 --> 00:46:24,430


1014
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:28,810
We used a few of these more commonly
than others but not all of these

1015
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,660
are for real.

1016
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:35,410
5 seconds to make your decision.

1017
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:41,680
And the results are BLOG is a
thing, STRING is not in SQLite.

1018
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,740
It's of course called
TEXT, as we've seen it.

1019
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,940
BLOB, as goofy as it sounds,
is just binary large object.

1020
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,660
But indeed, it's how you might store
a binary file in your database.

1021
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:53,890
All right.

1022
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:58,300
The rankings now, oh,
Guest8444 has eked ahead.

1023
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,530
So we move on to 14.

1024
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:03,670
"Which of the following is a
valid way to print exclamation,

1025
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:09,090
point exclamation, point exclamation
point, exclamation point, in Python?"

1026
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:12,570
And I'll let you read these yourselves.

1027
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:15,380
Which is a valid way?

1028
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,045
OK, everyone got quiet and is thinking.

1029
00:47:17,045 --> 00:47:20,370


1030
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,360
All right.

1031
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,365
6 seconds, a few hundred
responses in so far.

1032
00:47:25,365 --> 00:47:27,980


1033
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,320
All right, and yes, nicely done.

1034
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,920
78% is correct.

1035
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,190
You can use the star operator
to essentially multiply

1036
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,420
the character at left.

1037
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,280
All right, who's in the lead, Carter?

1038
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,090
We now have still Guest8444.

1039
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:43,160
And so we move on now to 15.

1040
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,370
"What does the free function do?"

1041
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:48,320
Deallocated memory from a primitive.

1042
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,390
Deallocated memory at the given pointer.

1043
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:53,900
Terminates a loop." or "Returns
a value from the function."

1044
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,700
"What does the free function do?"

1045
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:00,820


1046
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,800
All right, 5 seconds.

1047
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,480
"What does the free function do?"

1048
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,640
Call to the opposite
essentially of malloc.

1049
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,120
And it "Deallocates the
memory at the given pointer."

1050
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:10,880
as well.

1051
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,310
And in C, that's on you.

1052
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:16,720
In Python, you don't need to worry
about allocating or freeing alike.

1053
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,440
All right.

1054
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,780
We now have at the top, still Guest8444
and seeing more and more spread.

1055
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:27,550
16, "Which is not a step of compiling?

1056
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:30,400
Think back now to week 2.

1057
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,150
"Compiling.

1058
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,140
Preprocessing.

1059
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:32,740
Linking."

1060
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:33,790
or "Threading."

1061
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:38,230
"Which is not a step of compiling?"

1062
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:40,570
We use it as a catchall,
but it technically

1063
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:43,330
means a few different
things collectively.

1064
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:47,720


1065
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,290
All right.

1066
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:51,080
And threading is indeed not on the list.

1067
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,110
That is a technical
thing, generally meaning

1068
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:56,330
a program can do
multiple things at once,

1069
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:59,240
but that is not related
here to compiling.

1070
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,450
All right Guest8444 still at the top.

1071
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:04,040
We have just a few questions left.

1072
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:09,110
And so, 17 "What was the surprise at
the beginning of the Halloween lecture?"

1073
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:11,720
According to your classmates,
someone scared me,

1074
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,120
"Someone hid candy under every chair."

1075
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,650
Someone dressed up as me.

1076
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:17,705
"The entire staff dressed up as Carter."

1077
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:21,070


1078
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:27,910
Oh, interesting litmus test of who
came to or watched lecture perhaps.

1079
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:31,510
Let's see which guests got this correct.

1080
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:35,300
Someones really dressed
up as indeed me at 64%.

1081
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,390
So I think we have attendance here
essentially from that lecture.

1082
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:40,810
So let's move on now to
the final few questions

1083
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:44,710
after seeing that Guest8444
is still doing well.

1084
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,330
Can anyone dethrone them?

1085
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,870
"Why is it incorrect to use
the equals equals operator in C

1086
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:52,980
to compare strings?"

1087
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,600
"It is computationally inefficient.

1088
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,610
You're comparing the
locations of the strings.

1089
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:57,900
Strings don't exist.

1090
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,110
Using equal equals will
lead to buffer overflow."

1091
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:04,760


1092
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,660
"Why is it incorrect to use equal
equals in C to compare strings?"

1093
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:09,890
3 seconds.

1094
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:12,440
We saw this live, and it
motivated like an entire week

1095
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,850
because you're comparing the locations,
that is the addresses in memory

1096
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,030
of those same strings.

1097
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:18,530
All right.

1098
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:21,320
Let's see if this leaves
the rankings the same.

1099
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,800
Guest8444 is still at the
top and pulling ahead.

1100
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,930
Two final questions, 19.

1101
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:30,620
"What is the difference
between NUL" one L, "and NULL."

1102
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,740
Two Ls.

1103
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,330
NUL and NULL mean the same thing.

1104
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:39,470
NUL refers to backslash 0, whereas
NULL" 2 L's "is the 0 address.

1105
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:43,790
NUL is the zero address whereas NULL"
two L's "refers to backslash zero.

1106
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:47,690
NUL is NULL but lazier."

1107
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:49,630
5 seconds.

1108
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,320
Subtle.

1109
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,860
Not the best design perhaps
to have in technical terms,

1110
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:58,780
but indeed 62% of you got that and N-U-L
is the first thing we talked about when

1111
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:02,080
we talked about backslash
zero, and N-U-L-L is a pointer.

1112
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,790
It's the zero pointer.

1113
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:06,310
Same number, but different context.

1114
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,720
All right, Carter.

1115
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:13,300
Guest8444 is the person to beat
with our final 20th questions.

1116
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:17,100
"What do the binary bulbs
on stage spell today?"

1117
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,740


1118
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:25,000
And these are your four
choices, different from usual.

1119
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,770
We usually use 8-bit Ascii.

1120
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:31,720
Today we are using UTF8
which is a form of Unicode,

1121
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,230
which is the larger subset
that uses 1, or 2, or 3,

1122
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:39,920
or even 4 bytes to spell
a single character.

1123
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,350
And the answer, wow,
close, is indeed a cupcake.

1124
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:45,940
Indeed, a cupcake.

1125
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,020
Well done.

1126
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,880
And let's see the final results.

1127
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,860
8444 is the winner.

1128
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,230
Are they here in person, perhaps?

1129
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:54,790
8444.

1130
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:55,780
You're 8444.

1131
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,620
Come on down.

1132
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:59,105
[APPLAUSE]

1133
00:51:59,105 --> 00:52:03,715


1134
00:52:03,715 --> 00:52:04,390
Thank you.

1135
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:05,140
There you go.

1136
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:05,840
Congratulations.

1137
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,715
GUEST8444: Thank you.

1138
00:52:06,715 --> 00:52:08,050
DAVID J. MALAN: Thank you.

1139
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:09,040
All your.

1140
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,860
All right.

1141
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:17,410
Today if we may, give
me just one moment.

1142
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:24,860


1143
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,640
All right.

1144
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:35,600


1145
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,200
All right.

1146
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,700
So today we are so pleased
to be joined by Jennifer 8

1147
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,640
Lee who's an alumna of the
college, a dear friend,

1148
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,450
and is actually really the reason why
there's evidence of Muppets in CS50.

1149
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:50,300
In fact, some years
ago, I was visiting her

1150
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,910
and she had on her shelf
like this custom Muppet.

1151
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:56,480
It wasn't one that appears on TV, but
she had somehow gone on a website,

1152
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,217
a former toy store called
FAO Schwartz at the time,

1153
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,550
and you're allowed to configure
your own Muppet whatnot.

1154
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:03,633
Choose the eyes, the nose,
the face and the torso.

1155
00:53:03,633 --> 00:53:05,551
And I just thought this
was the coolest thing.

1156
00:53:05,551 --> 00:53:07,370
And so in the taxi on
the way home, I was

1157
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:10,850
like going on the website trying
to purchase our very first Muppet.

1158
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:12,950
I then sort of woke up
the next morning thinking,

1159
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:15,350
why did I just buy a puppet
in the back of a taxi?

1160
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:17,450
And so it sat on the shelf
for really two years.

1161
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:19,747
And then a colleague of
mine within CS50's team

1162
00:53:19,747 --> 00:53:22,580
decided, after I brought it into
the office to sit on a shelf there,

1163
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,170
to actually bring it to life.

1164
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:28,100
And indeed if you Google around and
CS50 Muppetry and puppetry online,

1165
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,187
you'll see in fact these
as characters, not only

1166
00:53:30,187 --> 00:53:32,270
over the past couple of
years in COVID times, when

1167
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:36,200
really there was next to no one
actually here, and so they were instead.

1168
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,710
But indeed she's brought not
only this educational element,

1169
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:42,530
this pedagogical element,
this playful element to CS50.

1170
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:46,400
And we have her here today to speak
to exactly the sorts of encodings

1171
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,600
that are here on stage.

1172
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,050
Jenny is the former Vice Chair
of the Unicode subcommittee

1173
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:53,930
on emoji, which is to say
that she and her colleagues

1174
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,480
have been influential in
taking emoji from what

1175
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,510
was a very limited character
set early on and by far

1176
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:04,760
unrepresentative of much human emotion
in speech into really an initiative now

1177
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,640
to capture digitally all
of the world's languages,

1178
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,300
past, present and future, as
well as the range of emotions

1179
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,730
that we might see here in
the form of that pillow

1180
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,350
or even in the cake that await.

1181
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:18,146
So allow me to introduce,
Jennifer 8 Lee.

1182
00:54:18,146 --> 00:54:18,646
JENNIFER 8.

1183
00:54:18,646 --> 00:54:19,310
LEE: Thank you.

1184
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:22,790


1185
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:24,830
I much drink.

1186
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:25,620
Clicker.

1187
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,120
Hi.

1188
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:26,420
All right.

1189
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:26,920
Hold on.

1190
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,660
I have to hide my drinks.

1191
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:29,660
I might need more water.

1192
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,160
All right.

1193
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,170
I'm really excited to speak.

1194
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:34,310
So speak your last time.

1195
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,595
Last year I was here.

1196
00:54:35,595 --> 00:54:38,720
One, I was wearing a mask, which is
like a real bummer if you're lecturing.

1197
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,540
And then the entire front
part was all Muppets.

1198
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,780
So I'm really happy to
see humans actually.

1199
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:48,380
And it's always an honor
to speak at Sanders.

1200
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,910
And then Dave and I were actually
classmates way back when.

1201
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:54,300
So I do remember him when he
was an undergrad much like you.

1202
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,560
So I am going to give a
talk on the world of emoji

1203
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,660
and how I kind of became
an emoji activist.

1204
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:04,820
So it kind of all starts
with my friend, Yiying Lu,

1205
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:07,760
who is a designer who's well
known for doing the Twitter fail

1206
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,350
whale, which was kind of laid to rest.

1207
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:15,540
Except now, this week it seems
like it may be necessary again.

1208
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,660
So she and I one day were texting.

1209
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:18,920
This is back in 2015.

1210
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,550
We're texting about dumplings
because we are Chinese-ish women

1211
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:24,510
and we like to text about food.

1212
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:26,540
And so I sent her this
picture of dumplings.

1213
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,660
She was like yum, yum, yum,
yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1214
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:34,638
And then she was like, oh, Apple
doesn't have a dumpling emoji.

1215
00:55:34,638 --> 00:55:36,680
And I was like, well,
that's kind of interesting.

1216
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:40,970
I didn't really think anything about it
because people point things out to you

1217
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:44,520
all the time, and then you just like
forget, and you just like move on.

1218
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:50,000
But then half an hour later, on my phone
appears this dumpling with heart eyes.

1219
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,490
And you don't see it because
this is a still shot,

1220
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:54,020
but it actually had blinking eyes.

1221
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,187
So she liked to call it
like bling, bling, dumpling.

1222
00:55:56,187 --> 00:56:00,620
So she as a designer had decided
to go in and make her own dumpling

1223
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,733
emoji because she was like,
I'm a designer, I can fix it.

1224
00:56:03,733 --> 00:56:05,150
But that actually got me thinking.

1225
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:07,670
I was like, where do emoji come from?

1226
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,800
And how is there not a dumpling emoji.

1227
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:14,000
Because from my perspective, dumplings
are this kind of universal food.

1228
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,510
Right.

1229
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:21,730
So and there are a lot of Japanese
foods on the emoji keyboard.

1230
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:23,560
And I was not, this
was like back in 2015.

1231
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,060
I was like not a big
emoji user like at all.

1232
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:28,180
So I mean, you have things like ramen.

1233
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,680
You have Bento boxes.

1234
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,910
You have curry.

1235
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:32,200
You have tempura.

1236
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,710
You even have kind of
obscure kind of foods

1237
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:40,060
like this thing, things on a stick,
turns out to be fish things on a stick.

1238
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:44,350
Then this pink and white swirly
thing is also a fish thing.

1239
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:46,510
And there's even like
that triangle rice ball

1240
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:49,780
that looks like it's had a
bikini wax, all well represented

1241
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,602
on the emoji keyboard, but no dumplings.

1242
00:56:52,602 --> 00:56:55,810
And it's very strange, because like all
cultures kind of have their dumpling,

1243
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:59,620
whether or not it's khinkali
or ravioli or empanadas,

1244
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,260
like essentially everyone
sort of like discovered

1245
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:07,270
the idea of yummy goodness
inside a carbohydrate shell,

1246
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:11,390
whether or not baked
or fried or steamed.

1247
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:16,270
So I was like, OK, I literally
Google was like who controls emoji.

1248
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:20,260
And you discover that they're actually
regulated by a nonprofit called

1249
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,850
the Unicode Consortium.

1250
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:25,930
And it is, and I just
went on their website

1251
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:30,070
and I discovered that they had 12
full voting members as of 2015.

1252
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:33,430
So this is 2015, and they were like
mostly US multinational tech companies.

1253
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:34,090
It was Oracle.

1254
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:40,120
It was IBM, Microsoft, Adobe,
Google, Apple, Facebook, and Yahoo.

1255
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:44,680
And of the three that were not
multinational US tech companies,

1256
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,340
there were, let's see a
German company called SAP.

1257
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:52,720
A Chinese telecom company called Huawei,
and then like the government of Oman.

1258
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,700
Those were basically the 12 full voting
members of the US multinational tech

1259
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:58,220
companies.

1260
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:03,460
So they at that point
paid $18,000 a year

1261
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:06,790
to have full voting power
on the Unicode committee.

1262
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:09,730
And I was like, oh,
that's a lot of money.

1263
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:13,055
And I kind of felt indignant about this.

1264
00:58:13,055 --> 00:58:15,430
But then if you kind of keep
on digging on their website,

1265
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:18,160
you found there was this kind
of interesting loophole, which

1266
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,660
is could join as an individual for $75.

1267
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,760
You don't get voting
power, but it gave you

1268
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,880
the right to put yourself
on the email list

1269
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,490
and also to attend the
quarterly Unicode meeting.

1270
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:31,690
So I was like, I'll do that.

1271
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:32,982
I had no idea what I was doing.

1272
00:58:32,982 --> 00:58:35,800
But I'm like, I'm going to go
fight for this dumpling emoji,

1273
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,980
because from my perspective,
dumplings are universal.

1274
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,000
Emoji are kind of universal.

1275
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,350
So the fact that there was no
dumpling emoji meant like something

1276
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:49,430
was wrong in the universe and
I was determined to fix this.

1277
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:50,950
You know I was on this email list.

1278
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:54,170
And then a couple of maybe, even
like a couple of weeks later,

1279
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:56,960
I got-- they kind of sent
out this note that's like,

1280
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,050
hey, who's coming to
the quarterly meeting.

1281
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:01,420
And I was like, I
looked at the calendar.

1282
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:02,450
I looked at my schedule.

1283
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:06,080
I was like, oh, I'll be in
Silicon Valley at that time.

1284
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,850
So I basically like RSVP and
I was like, I will be there

1285
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:13,827
and took Caltrain to an Apple building.

1286
00:59:13,827 --> 00:59:15,910
It's a legal building in
I think it was Sunnyvale.

1287
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:17,110
So I just like show up.

1288
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:20,680
And I don't know what I was sort of
expecting like with like the Unicode.

1289
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,440
I think I maybe that was going
to be like a baby Congress,

1290
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,650
like with a little very formal
seats, people with gavels.

1291
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,150
That is not what I found.

1292
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:30,760
Basically it is, it
was a conference room

1293
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,830
full of people who skewed wider, skewed
older, skewed male, skewed engineers.

1294
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:36,830
And this is basically the
room where it happens.

1295
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:38,710
So this is 2015.

1296
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:43,930
These were the people who decided
your emoji, all very nice and.

1297
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:47,290
There was one, even had a daughter
who had a sense of humor and made him

1298
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:50,860
a shirt that said
"Shadowy Emoji Overlord."

1299
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:55,690
So I just kind of listened to them
debate things like milk emoji and beans

1300
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:56,260
emoji.

1301
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,870
And it just seemed like
not quite right to me

1302
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:03,850
that it would be this global
visual language that were basically

1303
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:08,270
decided by like a small group of people
inside a conference room in Silicon

1304
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:08,920
Valley.

1305
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,250
So I decided to form a
group called Emojination,

1306
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,770
whose motto is like "Emoji by
the People, for the People."

1307
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:20,290
And it basically advocates for more
kind of representative inclusive emoji.

1308
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:25,120
We start with a Kickstarter
campaign, dumpling emoji

1309
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,730
process trying to right
the wrong in this world

1310
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:30,458
and made this little cute
video sort of advocating--

1311
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:32,500
NARRATOR: Dumpling are
one of the most universal,

1312
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,450
cross-cultural foods in the world.

1313
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:40,090
Georgia has khinkali Japan has gyoza,
Korea has mandu, Italy has ravioli,

1314
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:44,020
Poland has pierogi, Russia has
pelmani, Argentina has empanadas,

1315
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:47,020
Jewish people have kreplach,
China has potstickers,

1316
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:49,780
Nepal and Tibet have momos.

1317
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,970
Yet somehow, despite
their popularity, there

1318
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:54,700
is no dumpling emoji
in the standard set.

1319
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:55,750
Why is that?

1320
01:00:55,750 --> 01:01:00,320
Emoji exist for pizza, tempura, sushi,
spaghetti, hot dog and now tacos,

1321
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,600
which Taco Bell takes credit for.

1322
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,420
We need to right this disparity.

1323
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,680
Dumplings are global.

1324
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,145
Emoji are global.

1325
01:01:07,145 --> 01:01:08,770
Isn't it time we brought them together?

1326
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:11,380


1327
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:14,320
Oh, yeah, while we're at it, how
about an emoji for Chinese takeout?

1328
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,420


1329
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:17,920
JENNIFER 8.

1330
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,110
LEE: So I did put together
a dumpling emoji proposal.

1331
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:24,850
I wrote this, I remember
Thanksgiving Day 2015 on a plane.

1332
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:29,080
And actually, and we got it
passed, basically dumpling,

1333
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,590
takeout box, chopsticks
and fortune cookie.

1334
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:35,680
I have to say, I don't think
fortune cookie would have made it

1335
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,510
on its own merits, but
it kind of like slid

1336
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:40,070
in on the coattails of the other ones.

1337
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:42,790
And so these were the
proposals as we submitted them.

1338
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:46,475
And then these are the ones that kind
of exist now on the Apple keyboard.

1339
01:01:46,475 --> 01:01:48,350
And I have to say, the
dumpling looks really,

1340
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:51,190
really realistic, oddly realistic.

1341
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:54,160
And whereas, like the fortune
cookie I think is like a big fail,

1342
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,950
because first of all, there's
like, it has no-- it has no gap.

1343
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,750
It looks like a dead 3D Pac-Man.

1344
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:03,417
So I'm very disappointed in
the manifestation of that.

1345
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:04,000
But that's OK.

1346
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,110
That's OK.

1347
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:07,600
And so it's kind of
interesting, like what is

1348
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,660
the process of getting an emoji passed?

1349
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,220
And I will walk you through it.

1350
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:15,760
So first of all, you
come up with your idea.

1351
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,090
And then you write
this proposal and then

1352
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:22,420
you submit it to the Unicode emoji
subcommittee who then gives you

1353
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:24,070
comments and then sends it back to you.

1354
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:25,945
And you kind go around
and around the circle.

1355
01:02:25,945 --> 01:02:29,560


1356
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,197
So these are things that we consider.

1357
01:02:31,197 --> 01:02:34,030
So somewhere in there, I also fought
my way onto the emoji committee

1358
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:37,090
and then also became a Vice
Chair, became a Vice Chair.

1359
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:41,140
Sort of an extracurricular just
like completely run amok in my life.

1360
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:47,590
So things that matter popular demand,
is it a frequently requested emoji.

1361
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:51,940
Multiple usages and meanings, so
that's actually kind of very important

1362
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:55,130
for something like certain
animals have meaning.

1363
01:02:55,130 --> 01:03:01,000
So we did sloth a while ago, and that
also has not only the literal meaning

1364
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,120
but sort of like connotations.

1365
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:07,280
There are visually distinctiveness,
it can be recognized.

1366
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,720
So this was a blocker
for one of the emoji

1367
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,870
that I have worked on before which
is cave, which is kind of hard to do.

1368
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:17,650
I think, meaning wise, is pretty
good, but it's really hard

1369
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:20,140
to get a cave down in emoji sizes.

1370
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:22,120
And then it filling a gap, completeness.

1371
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:25,630
So a good example for that is like
for some reason, for many years,

1372
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:29,260
we had red heart, yellow heart, green
heart, blue heart, purple heart,

1373
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:31,840
and no orange heart.

1374
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,338
So somewhat, so you
would do the rainbow,

1375
01:03:34,338 --> 01:03:36,130
but people would
substitute the pumpkin in.

1376
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:39,280
So you would like have a rainbow heart
thing with a little pumpkin stuck

1377
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:39,890
in the middle.

1378
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:45,640
So orange heart obviously should be
added and give a sense of completeness.

1379
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:49,120
And then something else is
existing vendor compatibility.

1380
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:53,680
And so a good example for
that was many years ago

1381
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:58,150
WhatsApp decided to add the
gender non-binary emoji.

1382
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:03,860
And then once it did that, then all of
the other kind of vendors jumped on.

1383
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:06,580
So what kind of knocks out an emoji.

1384
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:08,830
So too specific or narrow.

1385
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:13,250
So we'll often see that with very
specific animals or a very specific

1386
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:13,750
group.

1387
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:18,312
It's redundant so one year, oh
my God, who makes a Butterball?

1388
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:19,520
Butterball makes the turkeys.

1389
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:24,202
Butterball submitted an emoji proposal
that was like a cooked turkey.

1390
01:04:24,202 --> 01:04:27,410
But we already had a live turkey so it
seemed kind of redundant to have both,

1391
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:29,810
like a cooked turkey for
Thanksgiving and a live turkey.

1392
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:33,410
So not visually discernible.

1393
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:36,200
This is a struggle for things
like, I know my friends have

1394
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:40,250
kind of proposed kimchi.

1395
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:44,992
Kimchi is really hard on emoji sizes for
many reasons and part of that tension

1396
01:04:44,992 --> 01:04:46,700
is because it's not
visually discernible.

1397
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,520
Then there are no logos brands,
deities, or celebrities.

1398
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,910
So no Nike swoosh, no
McDonald's M. And then

1399
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:57,200
this is one that we decide in the last
year or so which is no more flags.

1400
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,660
Flags are a very complicated thing.

1401
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:01,880
And as a result Unicode
does not want to be

1402
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,030
in a business of deciding what
is a country or not a country.

1403
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:08,840
So like when you get a proposal
from like Kurdistan, you're like--

1404
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,930
so right now, the way that
the emoji flags are decided

1405
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:14,750
is they kind of depend
on what the UN recognizes

1406
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:18,020
and then those get passed down to the
International Standards Organization

1407
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:19,460
and then Unicode just does that.

1408
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:25,700
It does not want to be in the
business of the geopolitical affairs.

1409
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:28,310
So once it comes out
of the subcommittee,

1410
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:31,250
it goes to the full Unicode
Technical Committee, UTC.

1411
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:34,550
Those were the people that were
in the room that I showed you.

1412
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:39,950
And they vote once a year
basically to pass all the emoji.

1413
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:40,967
And it takes a while.

1414
01:05:40,967 --> 01:05:43,550
There's a lot of coordinating
with the International Standards

1415
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:47,210
Organization and a lot of
working with the companies.

1416
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:50,750
And eventually, it takes a long
time, but it ends up on your devices.

1417
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:53,325
And that historically has
taken about 18 to 24 months

1418
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:55,700
from when you put it in a
proposal to when you get it in.

1419
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:00,920
It's going to be a little bit longer
going forward probably is my sense

1420
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,120
as we're organized--

1421
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,600
Unicode is designed to space out
some of the Unicode releases.

1422
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:09,750
So Emojination kind
of has done its thing.

1423
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:12,170
So one of the weird things
is like how did Unicode,

1424
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:15,050
this kind of non-profit
organization based in Mountain View,

1425
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:19,320
California end up controlling
this global visual language?

1426
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:22,580
So a lot of it has to start,
has it has to do with the fact

1427
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:26,450
that emoji started in Japan
back in the late 1990s.

1428
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:30,590
The set from Docomo
in 1999 is considered,

1429
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:33,620
is widely considered sort of like
the first like color emoji set.

1430
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:36,410
It has been collected by
the Museum of Modern Art.

1431
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:41,720
And so the Japanese telecom
companies would use basically,

1432
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,178
would have their own sets of emoji.

1433
01:06:43,178 --> 01:06:46,303
And then there were different companies,
so they would have different sets.

1434
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:49,550
So you could basically only send these
like visual characters with someone

1435
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:51,350
who is on your same carrier.

1436
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:55,040
So it's like basically equivalent
of if you were on like Verizon,

1437
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:58,010
you could only text people
on Verizon with like emoji.

1438
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:01,680
Or if you were on T-Mobile,
you could only do that.

1439
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:08,600
So at a certain point, they decided they
the Apple and Google came into Japan.

1440
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,550
They wanted to start
selling smartphones.

1441
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:14,270
And they realized that it
was a hodgepodge of systems

1442
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:16,380
and they wanted to unify it.

1443
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:19,820
And so in 2007, they went to
Unicode and they're like OK,

1444
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:26,220
help us unify the emoji, kind
of basically all the emojis

1445
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:27,870
so that we have one standard system.

1446
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:30,850
And part of the reason is why Unicode.

1447
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:32,600
Because Unicode basically
has this mission

1448
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,300
is to enable everyone speaking
every language on Earth

1449
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,940
to be able to use your languages
on computer and smartphone,

1450
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:43,850
so it basic unifies all written
languages into one ginormous set.

1451
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:47,400
And that was not the case
actually when I was growing up.

1452
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,300
There was a point where like
if you were Japanese on Apple

1453
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:54,620
that would be different than
Japanese on DOS or Chinese or Arabic.

1454
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:57,170
So it drove everyone
crazy and they basically

1455
01:07:57,170 --> 01:08:02,240
decided around the late '80s or early
1990s that they were going to come up

1456
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,700
with one standardized
system that sort of encoded

1457
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:09,060
all characters in one ginormous set.

1458
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:12,350
So there's three main projects
for Unicode if you care.

1459
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:14,930
So one is encoding
characters including emoji.

1460
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:17,569
Now there are about 100,000
characters aside assigned,

1461
01:08:17,569 --> 01:08:24,830
so that includes Chinese, Japanese,
Korean, Arabic, Cyrillic, actually

1462
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:29,930
all the hieroglyphics, all of the emoji,
a lot of things like the Bitcoin symbol

1463
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:31,490
or like copyleft or whatever.

1464
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:36,290
Those all assigned were about 100,000
characters, even those languages

1465
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:38,069
that are basically out of use.

1466
01:08:38,069 --> 01:08:44,689
So the other thing it does, it creates
localization resources so things so

1467
01:08:44,689 --> 01:08:49,520
that you know, oh, if you're in this
country this is you're using a euro

1468
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,569
or you're using the pesos or something.

1469
01:08:51,569 --> 01:08:54,800
So there's a lot of
localization data that

1470
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:59,600
is needed depending on which geography
you're using your device from,

1471
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,960
or that you know that the time is used
this way or dates are shown that way.

1472
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:09,240
So that is called the common local data
repository or CLDR as they call it.

1473
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,560
And the other thing they do is they kind
of maintain libraries for developers

1474
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,328
in order to do all--

1475
01:09:15,328 --> 01:09:18,370
so they are not building everything
from scratch, and that is called ICU.

1476
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:21,130
So it's very funny,
because it's called CLDR,

1477
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:24,520
and then one day, one of
our friend's girlfriends

1478
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:30,040
made him this thing which she
called a sealdeer, because whenever

1479
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:35,710
he talked about CLDR, she thought
he was talking about sealdeers.

1480
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:40,450
So now this is his little like mascot
for like Unicode related things.

1481
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:42,580
So how does Unicode do this?

1482
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:44,439
So basically it assigns code points.

1483
01:09:44,439 --> 01:09:48,910
And each code point is a unique number
assigned to each Unicode character,

1484
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:55,090
so face with tears of joy, it can be
written like this with a code point,

1485
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,597
or it can be written like this
in terms of decimal numbers.

1486
01:09:57,597 --> 01:09:59,680
And it can also written
in this in binary numbers.

1487
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,970
So these are all basically the same.

1488
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:04,270
And the key thing to know,
at least about emoji,

1489
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:07,300
is that when your device, if
you're talking on your iPhone

1490
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:11,800
with someone who's on a laptop or
an iPad or like an Android device,

1491
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,715
it's not sending the
images back and forth.

1492
01:10:13,715 --> 01:10:15,590
It's sending just a
number of back and forth.

1493
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:19,120
And then locally, your
phone, or like your laptop

1494
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:23,920
decides like, oh this number
correlates with which image in terms

1495
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,910
of our emoji font and then pulls it up.

1496
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:30,940
So this is really key to know why
different emoji look different

1497
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,020
on different platforms.

1498
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:36,320
So 2007 to 2010, it
took about three years,

1499
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:40,450
but Unicode 6.0 came out with our
first little baby set of emoji.

1500
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:42,430
And it just kind of hung
out there for a year.

1501
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:44,013
Like no one, it wasn't doing anything.

1502
01:10:44,013 --> 01:10:48,010
So 2011 though, Apple starts
adding the emoji keyboard

1503
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:52,930
and it just like explodes, like I
feel like in some ways, emoji are

1504
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:53,980
were not invented.

1505
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:54,970
They were discovered.

1506
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:58,120
They like obviously touch
something very, very primal

1507
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:04,030
to like our human desire to communicate
in like little colorful glyphs

1508
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:05,530
on electronic devices.

1509
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:08,260
And you kind of have what's
kind of really interesting

1510
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:13,570
is like the ambiguity that comes
with what emoji kind of mean.

1511
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:15,698
And so one this is one
of my favorite emoji.

1512
01:11:15,698 --> 01:11:18,490
It's sort of like an upside down
smiley face, very, very ambiguous.

1513
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:20,680
Clearly very ambiguous,
because if you start

1514
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,920
typing into Google, like the top hits
are like what does it mean from a guy.

1515
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,270
What does it mean from a girl.

1516
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:27,160
It's clearly something
that a lot of people

1517
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:30,820
are using in like complex
situation ships between each other.

1518
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:33,490


1519
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:36,310
So one of the fun things
is who can propose emoji.

1520
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:37,540
Technically anyone can.

1521
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,590
Anyone here can.

1522
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:40,240
Normal humans can.

1523
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,850
We have basically Google
Doc or Google Form

1524
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:46,480
that we throw up historically
between August, sorry April

1525
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,100
and August in the last two years.

1526
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:53,330
And so this is one of
our favorite examples.

1527
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:54,730
This is Rayouf Alhumedhl.

1528
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:58,600
She was a 15-year-old Saudi Arabian girl
who was living in Vienna at the time

1529
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:02,440
that she proposed the hijab emoji.

1530
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,072
And then she was like Time
Magazine like coolest teens

1531
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:07,030
she got like a whole
bunch of different things.

1532
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:08,510
She got into Harvard and Stanford.

1533
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:09,552
And she went to Stanford.

1534
01:12:09,552 --> 01:12:12,700


1535
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:13,930
So this is a proposal we got.

1536
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:16,090
Then there was a group
of folks from Argentina

1537
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:20,350
who got the mate emoji, kind of
the symbol of their national drink.

1538
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:24,520
Then we worked with, there was
a nonprofit that really wanted

1539
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:30,850
to get a menstruation emoji and so
what they proposed to begin with

1540
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:32,480
was like bloody underwear.

1541
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,870
And I was just like no, no, no.

1542
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:38,650
So many different reasons
why this is a terrible emoji.

1543
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:41,403
So we did get blood drops
and you can do moon and blood

1544
01:12:41,403 --> 01:12:42,820
drop or underwear and blood drops.

1545
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,153
There's a lot of different ways.

1546
01:12:44,153 --> 01:12:47,140
Actually it's really funny, because
I was polling my friends beforehand

1547
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:50,320
what they would use to
indicate menstruation

1548
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,430
before there was a blood drop.

1549
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:54,220
So there was like red wine.

1550
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:59,050
There was kind of that rose
with the like falling petal.

1551
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:01,810
And then my favorite
is actually my friend

1552
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:04,090
who used a Japanese flag
as a way to indicate

1553
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:06,830
that she was having her period.

1554
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:11,890
So one of the biggest
contributors, this skin tone emoji

1555
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:13,480
appeared, I think in 2015.

1556
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,600
It was amazing.

1557
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,100
It is.

1558
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:18,700
And it was proposed by
a mom, Katrina Parrott.

1559
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:21,940
She is an entrepreneur and a
mom who is just like at home

1560
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:24,100
one day and her daughter
comes home and is

1561
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:28,680
like I wish there were
emoji that looked like me.

1562
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,020
And her mom was like,
that's great, honey.

1563
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:32,130
What's an emoji?

1564
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:36,150
And so she, like me, I guess
googled and just figure it out

1565
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:38,490
that Unicode controlled emoji.

1566
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:41,130
And she just came up with a
proposal saying we should not only

1567
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:42,690
have the yellow skin tones.

1568
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:45,540
At that time, everything was
sort of Simpson's yellow.

1569
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:52,350
It's really interesting to see how
race and nationality are depicted

1570
01:13:52,350 --> 01:13:53,920
in different parts of the world.

1571
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:59,910
So originally in Japan, everyone
was yellow, but these were the non--

1572
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:03,450
by default, everyone was
just like human or Japanese.

1573
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:05,880
But they had like a couple
of things that were like not.

1574
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,520
One was, you had a blonde person.

1575
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,830
So there's an emoji
called like blonde woman

1576
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:13,403
or whatever that
represents all Westerners.

1577
01:14:13,403 --> 01:14:14,070
So that was one.

1578
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:16,923
And then they have one that's
like an Indian guy with a turban.

1579
01:14:16,923 --> 01:14:18,840
So that's supposed to
represent Indian people.

1580
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:23,225
And then there's like a guy with a
little like little hat that's supposed

1581
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:24,600
to represent like Chinese people.

1582
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:29,040
So that was like that the Japanese view
of race which was like default, then

1583
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:32,400
you were then you were like
blonde Western, Chinese or Indian.

1584
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,450
And that is all there was.

1585
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:38,590
And obviously in the United
States, we care a lot about race.

1586
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:42,210
And then so she came up with
a system with five skin tones

1587
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:43,830
like just like normal people.

1588
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:45,630
Some guy in Germany
decided that he wanted

1589
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:51,255
to do a face with one eyebrow raised,
or as we call it the [? cobara ?] emoji.

1590
01:14:51,255 --> 01:14:54,540


1591
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:55,500
Oh, this one's fun.

1592
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,210
So woman's flat shoe.

1593
01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:00,150
I have to say, not highly used
statistically at this point.

1594
01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:02,130
But I really kind of
appreciate it because it

1595
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:06,000
was a mom who was very offended
that all women shoes had heels, even

1596
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:06,840
the sandals.

1597
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,570
So this is her, she had
like three kids at the time.

1598
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:10,350
She now has four.

1599
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:12,210
She was very fertile.

1600
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:19,380
And she also did the women's flat--

1601
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:25,322
she also did one piece bathing
suit because she was also

1602
01:15:25,322 --> 01:15:27,780
offended by the fact that the
only kind of bathing suit you

1603
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:29,852
had was like this
little itsy bitsy polka

1604
01:15:29,852 --> 01:15:33,060
dot bikini thing, which is not great if
you're like taking your six-year-old.

1605
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:35,850
So I would say that got passed,
but like it didn't go over

1606
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:37,950
super well with everyone.

1607
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:41,880
So you know Unicode, because it's very
public, submits things for comments.

1608
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:46,350
And we got this comment back,
so one piece bathing suit, why?

1609
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:50,370
A person wanting to indicate the use
of swimwear can't use existing bikini.

1610
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:52,330
Is this really necessary?

1611
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:56,050
What about a Victorian bathing
costume or wetsuit or [INAUDIBLE]..

1612
01:15:56,050 --> 01:16:01,860
This is like literally in like the
records, and like do not encode.

1613
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:04,530
And so the person who did
this, actually very impressive.

1614
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:08,970
He's actually the person who
created the middle finger emoji.

1615
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:12,720
And actually if you've ever seen the
Vulcan emoji, the Vulcan hand emoji,

1616
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,670
he's actually very active.

1617
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:17,970
And I have to say this is actually I
think one of the more impressive emoji.

1618
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:21,750
So obviously, obviously we
have a lot of active debate.

1619
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:24,390
Sometimes you get like
whole countries submitting.

1620
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:27,300
So literally the government of
Finland, as in like their equivalent

1621
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:30,270
of the State Department,
their diplomacy kind of thing,

1622
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:32,640
submitted a proposal for sauna.

1623
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:39,580
And these were so creepy and so weird.

1624
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:42,330
So much is wrong with this.

1625
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:46,560
But I felt where they were coming
from, for like they're naked.

1626
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,050
They have no-- they're club feet.

1627
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:50,760
And so we decided to help them.

1628
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:53,350
We're like OK, we see where
you're going with this.

1629
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:57,627
Let's see if we can help you like come
up, you know like we had this spoon.

1630
01:16:57,627 --> 01:16:59,460
Like should there be
like steam around them.

1631
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:02,820
Like should they be naked or wearing
a towel was like super dicey.

1632
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:04,950
But we wanted to help them
because it was literally

1633
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:08,580
a foreign government coming in front of
Unicode advocating for the sauna emoji

1634
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:10,180
on behalf of their entire country.

1635
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:14,760
So then this-- it's evolved into
this basically person in steamy room

1636
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:18,390
which is the most sort of
like the PG version of sauna.

1637
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:19,265
And there's no spoon.

1638
01:17:19,265 --> 01:17:20,098
They're all dressed.

1639
01:17:20,098 --> 01:17:20,790
It's very odd.

1640
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:24,090
But so you can see the evolution
of what it started out.

1641
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:27,060
What we submitted and
what it ended up so.

1642
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:31,110
There's a lot of evolution
throughout the entire process.

1643
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:34,500
And like companies can
submit emoji proposals too.

1644
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,190
So Google actually worked on this one.

1645
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:36,930
I love this one.

1646
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:39,420
So just to give you some
context, as of 2015,

1647
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:42,810
there are many ways you could
be or have an occupation

1648
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:45,930
as a male on the emoji keyboard.

1649
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:49,328
Like for example, you
could be a police officer.

1650
01:17:49,328 --> 01:17:50,370
You could be a detective.

1651
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:52,650
You could be Buckingham Palace guard.

1652
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:54,180
You could even be Santa Claus.

1653
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:56,250
Like these are so many
jobs that you could have.

1654
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:58,230
But if you were a
woman as of 2015, there

1655
01:17:58,230 --> 01:17:59,970
were four things that you could be.

1656
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:00,970
You could be a princess.

1657
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:02,280
You could be a bride.

1658
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:05,070
You could be a dancer, or
you could be a Playboy bunny.

1659
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:09,240
These were the sum total of all
the occupations that we could have.

1660
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:12,450
So there was sort of this
movement at that time,

1661
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:15,410
there was like this video on
YouTube that like went viral.

1662
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:17,160
There was like a New
York Times op-ed that

1663
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,118
was like, where are the
women with professions?

1664
01:18:19,118 --> 01:18:24,210
So basically they came up with
a set of emoji for professions.

1665
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:27,700
And what's nice is not did women have
these professions, now men have them

1666
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:28,200
too.

1667
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:32,310
So of an Emojination emoji, these are
some of the ones that we've worked on.

1668
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:35,250
I think about 130 of the
emoji on your keyboard

1669
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:39,180
probably came through, touched
our system in some way, including,

1670
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:42,150
I have to say microbe or virus.

1671
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:45,390
I think, I have the opinion
that every emoji has its day.

1672
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:47,305
It might not be like today.

1673
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:50,430
It might not be next year, but I have
to say, virus was not doing anything.

1674
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:54,550
Then came 2020, and that was like such
a good moment for it, along with soap.

1675
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:55,830
We had also done soap.

1676
01:18:55,830 --> 01:19:00,300
So among the other emoji
that we have worked on

1677
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:03,360
are, sorry, mooncake, llama, teddy bear.

1678
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,230
There were no toys.

1679
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:05,680
I felt really sad for toys.

1680
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,890
We have giraffe.

1681
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:08,760
There was hut.

1682
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:09,480
Bubble tea.

1683
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,850
Bubble tea was very
controversial, actually.

1684
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:16,470
I have to say, we try to slide it
in originally with the takeout box

1685
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:18,973
and the dumplings and
people were not having it.

1686
01:19:18,973 --> 01:19:19,890
And I understand that.

1687
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:21,180
Because there's not a lot.

1688
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:25,110
Like compared to beer or wine,
like bubble tea is not long,

1689
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:27,540
does not have a long
history on this planet.

1690
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:34,620
But I will say that they submit it
again, actually kind of originally

1691
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:36,420
proposing that it was
not just bubble tea,

1692
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:39,150
but like a black ball and milk and tea.

1693
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:40,200
It was kind of cool.

1694
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,230
And I have to say there was
definitely a generational divide

1695
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:46,170
between the Asian women who
sit in that room and are

1696
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:48,270
like this absolutely is
a thing that we consume

1697
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:51,180
like almost like every week
of our life, and people

1698
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:54,090
who are a little bit older who are
like, that looks like a parfait.

1699
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:55,798
How do you not know
that's not a parfait?

1700
01:19:55,798 --> 01:19:58,230
We're like, we absolutely
know it is not a parfait.

1701
01:19:58,230 --> 01:19:59,910
And so it got in, eventually.

1702
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:01,230
So it does sort of influence.

1703
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:06,180
It kind of shows who is in the
room influences the decisions that

1704
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:10,740
get made or sometimes in the room,
now sometimes more likely in the Zoom.

1705
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:14,310
I actually had to say Beaver emoji,
if you see Beaver emoji, that's

1706
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,870
one of the ones I'm most proud of.

1707
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:18,240
So that is actually
co-authored by a professor

1708
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:23,760
here at Harvard who is both lesbian
and was married to a woman from Canada.

1709
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,570
So it was very important to her
to get the Beaver emoji passed.

1710
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:31,950
And she promised me it would always
be the first line of her bio.

1711
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:34,470
And indeed, if you go
to her Twitter handle.

1712
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:38,760
It's like Joan Donovan, creator
of the Beaver emoji, comma,

1713
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:42,890
is Head of Research at the Shorenstein
Center at the Harvard Kennedy School.

1714
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:45,070
It's pretty impressive.

1715
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:46,290
And then we did greens.

1716
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:49,487
Actually greens was really
interesting because people,

1717
01:20:49,487 --> 01:20:51,570
this was also like a
generational, cultural thing.

1718
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:53,280
People were like, why do we need greens?

1719
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,060
We have salad.

1720
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:55,828
And I was like, we're Chinese.

1721
01:20:55,828 --> 01:20:58,620
We don't eat raw greens because
like you don't know where it's been

1722
01:20:58,620 --> 01:20:59,460
or if it's clean.

1723
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:02,310
So we cook our greens so salad
is not something that we have.

1724
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:06,233
So eventually I got my greens
and so that was kind of fun.

1725
01:21:06,233 --> 01:21:09,150
And then so these were some of the
people who sort of have contributed

1726
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:12,720
to our little Emojination things,
including a number of Native Americans

1727
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:13,650
who help get feather.

1728
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:15,000
So why do I care?

1729
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,800
So part of it is because I'm Chinese.

1730
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,133
I grew up speaking Chinese
and English at the same time.

1731
01:21:19,133 --> 01:21:22,800
And it's really interesting to see
like Chinese and English characters

1732
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,020
in terms of emoji and
Chinese together, right.

1733
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,312
So this is fire.

1734
01:21:26,312 --> 01:21:28,770
You have fire characters and
now you have the emoji things.

1735
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:32,370
And it kind of shows that there is
a longevity in the human experience

1736
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:35,670
of something that was designed for
4,000 years ago has the same visual cues

1737
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:37,350
in the human experiences as now.

1738
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:42,330
So mouth, tree, moon, sun.

1739
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:45,250
They can mix and match
them, which is super fun.

1740
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:49,590
So two trees kind of make
a forest, oops, sorry.

1741
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:50,235
Oh well.

1742
01:21:50,235 --> 01:21:59,220
And then the moon and sun together
means bright, which I like.

1743
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:00,100
I like this one.

1744
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:02,610
So if you stop and you
think about this, so this

1745
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:07,950
is basically a pig under a roof.

1746
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:09,930
And what does that mean?

1747
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:11,810
It does not mean farm
as you might think.

1748
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:14,460
It actually means home or family.

1749
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:18,410
So in the Chinese kind of
structure and outlook on the view,

1750
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:22,370
it's like where you keep your pigs
is actually where your home is

1751
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:24,560
and what your farm is.

1752
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,720
So it gets kind of weird
in all kinds of ways.

1753
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:32,750
So one of my favorite radicals,
so this character means woman, me.

1754
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:38,830
And as I was learning Chinese, you
kind of notice like how it shows up.

1755
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:44,310
So this is a woman underneath a roof
and you're like oh it means mom or wife

1756
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:47,760
or whatever like home.

1757
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:48,540
It does not.

1758
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:54,840
It means peace, because things are
at home when the woman is or things

1759
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,330
are at peace when the woman
is at home underneath a roof,

1760
01:22:58,330 --> 01:23:00,210
which I always thought
was little bit odd.

1761
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:04,900
Then there is also woman plus child.

1762
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:07,503
So you're like oh, and actually
specifically boy child.

1763
01:23:07,503 --> 01:23:09,420
The connotation there
is a little bit unclear.

1764
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:13,710
So you're like a woman plus
child, family, mom, whatever.

1765
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:14,400
It is not.

1766
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,180
It means good.

1767
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:19,720
So the standard for goodness in ancient
China was a woman who had a male child.

1768
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:23,850
So that kind of just like
kind of irked me growing up.

1769
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:29,400
And then three women together
means evil which is very Macbeth.

1770
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,280
This character means greed.

1771
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,620
This character means slave.

1772
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:37,680
This marriage, let's see I
think this one is jealousy

1773
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:41,100
and this means adultery or betrayal.

1774
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:44,370
So like definitely not
loving the way women

1775
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:47,490
were portrayed on the emoji keyboard.

1776
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:49,860
So in case you're
wondering, we just came out

1777
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:54,030
with a kids book called "Hanmoji" that
kind of compares emoji and Chinese.

1778
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:56,610
And I think they sent
a whole bunch of books

1779
01:23:56,610 --> 01:24:01,620
so that you guys can do some kind
of contests like later on with CS50.

1780
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:04,530
So but the mixing and matching
is really interesting.

1781
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:09,240
For example, the skin tones are
actually the same yellow character

1782
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:11,410
plus a layer of skin
tone on top of that.

1783
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:13,620
So I kind of took my
lessons from Chinese

1784
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:15,847
in terms of seeing how
things can combine.

1785
01:24:15,847 --> 01:24:18,430
So there's something that you
should know about, which is ZWJ.

1786
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:20,610
This is also an invisible
emoji character.

1787
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:22,440
It stands for zero with joiner.

1788
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,720
And it was actually
originally created for I

1789
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:28,950
think Arabic where you would
basically kind of force something

1790
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:32,040
to have be in the beginning of
a word or an end of the word

1791
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,710
by kind of having this
invisible character.

1792
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:39,900
So the rainbow flag for example is
actually a rainbow plus the white flag.

1793
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:43,290
And we could have all
kinds of fun combinations.

1794
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:45,750
If you look at polar
bear, it actually is,

1795
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:47,940
if you have an older device
where it breaks apart,

1796
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:51,000
it is bear plus snow
which is really cute.

1797
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,880
It was originally, I
had bear plus white,

1798
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:57,550
and then we decided that bear
plus snow made a lot more sense.

1799
01:24:57,550 --> 01:25:01,527
So another one, this is
new, I think you guys

1800
01:25:01,527 --> 01:25:04,360
should have it if you've updated
your phones in the last year or so.

1801
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:08,862
So mending heart is heart plus band-aid.

1802
01:25:08,862 --> 01:25:09,570
What is this one?

1803
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:11,610
Oh, this is interesting.

1804
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:14,278
There was a breastfeeding
woman for a long time

1805
01:25:14,278 --> 01:25:16,320
and people felt like there
was not gender parity.

1806
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,320
It was actually really interesting,
all the people who wrote in and were

1807
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:22,290
like I want to be a dad showing
that I'm holding my baby.

1808
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:24,270
Why is there only a
woman holding my baby?

1809
01:25:24,270 --> 01:25:26,770
So we kind of created a whole set.

1810
01:25:26,770 --> 01:25:29,800
So this is man plus bottle.

1811
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,030
Ta-dah.

1812
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:32,940
And so this is an-- all
of these occupations

1813
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:37,110
are actually oftentimes a
woman plus, like the fried egg

1814
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:41,160
or like a school or a tractor and
that's how you got the occupations.

1815
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:47,260
If you send an emoji over into an older
system, sometimes it'll break apart.

1816
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:50,790
So one of my kind of favorite kind
of contributions in this world

1817
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:54,300
is interracial couple emoji
which we did with Tinder

1818
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:58,440
which is super fun because then you
could have different couples that

1819
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,750
are, and like so many [INAUDIBLE].

1820
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:04,300
This is a fun, if you guys ever have
to do a [? combinatoric ?] test.

1821
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:06,390
This is really fun because
you have to genders

1822
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:10,200
plus a third like neutral
gender plus two people

1823
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:15,240
plus five skin tones plus yellow, like
how many emoji couples can you come up

1824
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:16,740
with when you introduce this factor.

1825
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:20,727
So this is-- and underneath
it, it's just a ZWJ sequence,

1826
01:26:20,727 --> 01:26:23,560
it's like two people standing
together that are like glued together.

1827
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:27,150
Now this actually gets interesting
from a CS50 perspective because

1828
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:31,890
in many cases, even though you only
see one character underneath the hood

1829
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:33,750
depending on how your
system works, they're

1830
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:36,360
counting each one of these
as an individual character.

1831
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,360
So your string length actually
might be five instead of one.

1832
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,820
And this kind of became a
problem with things like Twitter

1833
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:44,160
where things had a hard skin length.

1834
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:47,130
So gender inclusivity is
actually one of the things

1835
01:26:47,130 --> 01:26:51,180
that we've been dealing most
with in the last couple of years.

1836
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:53,670
So it's kind of interesting
if you think about both

1837
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:55,650
what a pictorial language
looks like versus

1838
01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:58,410
the abstractness of a spoken language.

1839
01:26:58,410 --> 01:27:02,250
So because we had boy and we had girl.

1840
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,650
But there was no way
to say generic child.

1841
01:27:04,650 --> 01:27:07,780
Like if you were, you want to say
child, you had to pick a boy or a girl,

1842
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:11,610
but not a way to say
just some little person.

1843
01:27:11,610 --> 01:27:13,890
And that's really key
because in English at least

1844
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:18,040
there is no gender implied by child.

1845
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,100
So how do we mimic that?

1846
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:24,270
And also is key for something like
doctor, right, doctor and teacher.

1847
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:27,480
Those don't have gender
implied, but when

1848
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,760
we have them on the
emoji keyboard, you'd

1849
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:35,150
pick a male teacher or a
female doctor or whatnot.

1850
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:40,240
So there was actually a guy at Adobe
who considers himself non-gender binary

1851
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:44,200
also the man behind the orange heart.

1852
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:51,650
He fought and got basically the first
three non-gender, the non-gender binary

1853
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:52,150
emoji.

1854
01:27:52,150 --> 01:27:55,430
So child, adult, and the older adults.

1855
01:27:55,430 --> 01:27:56,770
So those are creative.

1856
01:27:56,770 --> 01:27:58,768
And then we started
having to propagate them

1857
01:27:58,768 --> 01:28:00,310
through actually all the occupations.

1858
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:03,530
So these are the gender neutral
versions of many of those.

1859
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:06,160
But then we got into
this whole thing where

1860
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:09,520
every emoji that had a gender
originally had to be mirrored.

1861
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,310
So originally we had bearded
man, and then we're like, OK,

1862
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:14,260
well we actually have
to get bearded woman.

1863
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:15,520
So that is on your keyboard.

1864
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:16,990
There is pregnant woman.

1865
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:21,130
There is now pregnant
man, which is interesting.

1866
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:24,220
There is woman in a bridal gown.

1867
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:26,360
There is now man in a bridal gown.

1868
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,360
And then there were ones
that actually had to be

1869
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:31,120
created that were neither man or woman.

1870
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,398
So this is a merperson.

1871
01:28:32,398 --> 01:28:34,940
So there was merman, there's
mermaid and there was merperson.

1872
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:36,773
It was really interesting
to figure out, how

1873
01:28:36,773 --> 01:28:38,443
do you draw a gender neutral merperson.

1874
01:28:38,443 --> 01:28:40,360
Like a bunch of them in
the beginning actually

1875
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:43,300
had the arms crossed around the chest.

1876
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:46,510
Monarch, so there was prince and
princess, and now there is monarch.

1877
01:28:46,510 --> 01:28:49,420
And one of my favorite actually
is there was Santa Claus

1878
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:51,530
and there was Mrs. Claus
and now there's Mx.

1879
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:52,030
Claus.

1880
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:54,490
Like the name of this
character literally in Unicode

1881
01:28:54,490 --> 01:28:57,010
is Mx Claus so I feel like it's
sort of like a very official

1882
01:28:57,010 --> 01:29:01,720
enshrining of gender
non-binaryness in like the world.

1883
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:02,710
Not everyone loved it.

1884
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:05,740
New York Post did not
love this, like we're

1885
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:08,650
cutting of into like emoji woke wars.

1886
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:10,458
So some emoji stats for you.

1887
01:29:10,458 --> 01:29:11,500
This is very fascinating.

1888
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,960
This is sort of like the
general distribution.

1889
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:16,480
By far, the single
emoji that you use more

1890
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:19,330
than anything else is the
face with tears of joy,

1891
01:29:19,330 --> 01:29:22,840
about 10% of all emoji
sent is that one character.

1892
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:26,600
And the number two is heart, red
heart, and then it kind of goes down.

1893
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,110
So there's a frequency of emoji use.

1894
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:32,780
This is sort of done
by order of magnitude.

1895
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:35,820
So 1 is 1/2 of 2.

1896
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:37,760
2 is 1/2 of 1 so duh, duh.

1897
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:38,760
It's really interesting.

1898
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:42,180
It's a very, very steep drop off
after the first couple in case

1899
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:46,470
you ever want to go on to the
emoji kind of Unicode website,

1900
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:49,180
you too can see all
the frequency things.

1901
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:50,560
So I think it's really funny.

1902
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,740
So basically if it's
green going this way,

1903
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:56,160
it increased in usage
between 2019 and 2021.

1904
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,780
And it's red going this way, it drop.

1905
01:29:57,780 --> 01:30:01,500
And so pleading face, which is a
relatively new emoji, just sort of

1906
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,770
shot up on the charts.

1907
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:08,340
And whereas actually like
smiley face with heart eyes

1908
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:12,100
actually kind of slipt
which is interesting.

1909
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:15,510
So we just closed our emoji
proposal around for 2022.

1910
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:16,830
These were the breakdowns.

1911
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:20,310
People love submitting smileys and
food and beverages, animals and nature.

1912
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:23,638
I mean, these are very googly colors.

1913
01:30:23,638 --> 01:30:24,930
So what is the future of emoji?

1914
01:30:24,930 --> 01:30:28,650
I will tell you because we just
had a meeting two weeks ago

1915
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:30,480
so I can now publicly talk about it.

1916
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,700
So historically, there
was this whole idea

1917
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:36,990
like Unicode doesn't want to be
in the world of like encoding

1918
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:38,988
glyphs for like devices everywhere.

1919
01:30:38,988 --> 01:30:41,280
There was very controversial
when I started doing that,

1920
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,730
because mostly what Unicode used to
do was you take an existing language.

1921
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:48,450
It could be done, you know and then
it would just take it and digitize.

1922
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:51,750
It took languages that existed
and just digitized them.

1923
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:55,950
And then when it kind of wandered
into emoji world, suddenly

1924
01:30:55,950 --> 01:31:01,840
it's like deciding what deserves to be
like an emoji decides to be digitized.

1925
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:08,040
So trying to get out of it and they have
proposals over time or it's like, oh,

1926
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:12,240
maybe we should like come up with a way
to send pictures back and forth where

1927
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:15,960
you it's a fixed
picture and you like use

1928
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:20,460
a hash so that we would look
at the picture and then go

1929
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:21,870
do a lookup somewhere.

1930
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:23,250
That did not go over well.

1931
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:25,950
Then there was actually a really
interesting proposal I kind

1932
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:29,970
of like, didn't go over well, which is
using something called a queue ID which

1933
01:31:29,970 --> 01:31:31,990
is in the Wikipedia world.

1934
01:31:31,990 --> 01:31:38,100
So in Wikipedia world, items all have
numbers across the different language

1935
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:38,610
Wikipedia.

1936
01:31:38,610 --> 01:31:42,790
So Obama, human, Earth,
they will have an ID number,

1937
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:46,890
so that the page in English and the
page in German the page in Chinese

1938
01:31:46,890 --> 01:31:48,948
all know that they're
pointing to the same thing.

1939
01:31:48,948 --> 01:31:51,240
So the question, so one idea
came up, like why don't we

1940
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:56,280
use the numbering system so we can use
like Eiffel tower and see the number

1941
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:59,370
and then like, oh, people know like
oh you're, trying to say Eiffel tower.

1942
01:31:59,370 --> 01:32:00,670
That did not go over well.

1943
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:04,390
So both of those proposals
seem dead as of yet.

1944
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:07,360
And it's too bad because
you'll see what's happening.

1945
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:08,610
So what's coming in 2022?

1946
01:32:08,610 --> 01:32:11,362
So these are the emoji that
I actually sort of thought

1947
01:32:11,362 --> 01:32:14,070
they would be on your phones by
now because we're in mid-November

1948
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:15,700
and they usually update early November.

1949
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:16,710
So three more hearts.

1950
01:32:16,710 --> 01:32:19,230
People love hearts.

1951
01:32:19,230 --> 01:32:23,430
Wing, blackbird, goose, birds
also, purple flowers, jellyfish,

1952
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:26,130
moose face donkey, donkey
was a bit late for the kind

1953
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:33,520
of elections, ginger, peapod, wireless,
khanda, shaking face, folding hand

1954
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:34,020
fans.

1955
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:36,645
That one was interesting because
when people first proposed it,

1956
01:32:36,645 --> 01:32:40,585
they proposed it as like an
electric fan and that didn't--

1957
01:32:40,585 --> 01:32:42,960
who knows what electric fans
will look like in 100 years?

1958
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:45,168
Because the thing is, once
an emoji, always an emoji.

1959
01:32:45,168 --> 01:32:46,170
They never retire.

1960
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:49,620
So they're always looking for things
that have a long visual longevity,

1961
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:52,390
floppy disk, do not actually do that.

1962
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:54,840
So there's always like, we
don't want another floppy disk.

1963
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:56,310
And then hair pick is interesting.

1964
01:32:56,310 --> 01:33:02,683
So there was a whole debate about
how to convey like Afro African hair,

1965
01:33:02,683 --> 01:33:05,100
like the curly hair that they
introduced a couple of years

1966
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,490
ago is supposed to do that.

1967
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:09,898
And most of the vendors actually have it
in a sort of Afro way except for Apple.

1968
01:33:09,898 --> 01:33:11,190
So there's a lot of complaints.

1969
01:33:11,190 --> 01:33:14,010
But hair pick was sort
of an interesting way.

1970
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:17,850
It means both comb but also has sort
of an interesting historic connotation,

1971
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:20,520
and it's been around
for about 2,00 years.

1972
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:22,890
A couple of music things,
maracas and flute.

1973
01:33:22,890 --> 01:33:27,440
Beyond 2022, one of the things that's
going to die, oops, can I go back?

1974
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,220
No, I can't.

1975
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:33,530
Oh well, we're going to
retire the family emoji.

1976
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:34,790
They didn't go over so well.

1977
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:36,110
There were so many of them.

1978
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:41,540
It's combinatorically if you had all
the everything in all the races all,

1979
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:43,370
the races, all because
you wanted to have

1980
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:45,182
skin tones, because
you didn't want imply

1981
01:33:45,182 --> 01:33:46,640
that families can only be one race.

1982
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:48,470
It was such a ordeal.

1983
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:52,070
Essentially, we're all like, no one
uses them, and there are so many.

1984
01:33:52,070 --> 01:33:54,650
And it's like the fonts
like in terms of the load

1985
01:33:54,650 --> 01:33:57,890
is like too large so they're just going
to make them all into like basically

1986
01:33:57,890 --> 01:34:01,100
little like bathroom symbol type folks.

1987
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:03,080
So I think that is,
those will disappear.

1988
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:06,342
What's actually really interesting about
the family emoji is they had gay fam.

1989
01:34:06,342 --> 01:34:09,050
When they introduced the family
emoji, they had gay family emoji,

1990
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:11,510
and the Russian government went berserk.

1991
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:14,510
And actually you can Google this in
2015, you'll see a bunch of articles

1992
01:34:14,510 --> 01:34:18,372
about the Russian government considering
it homosexual propaganda to use.

1993
01:34:18,372 --> 01:34:20,330
And there was a big debate
about whether or not

1994
01:34:20,330 --> 01:34:21,620
they were going to ban Apple devices.

1995
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:24,203
And so you can see a lot of the
media coverage from that time.

1996
01:34:24,203 --> 01:34:28,820
But I thought it was really interesting
how upset a national government can get

1997
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:32,300
about little pictures on your phone.

1998
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:36,290
Another thing that's on the
agenda as of a couple of weeks ago

1999
01:34:36,290 --> 01:34:39,200
is directionality in terms of emoji.

2000
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:42,000
So as you know, most emoji kind
of just flip one way or another.

2001
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,200
And the reason why it matters
is because not all languages

2002
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:46,560
run in the same direction.

2003
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,170
So for example, Arabic.

2004
01:34:48,170 --> 01:34:53,520
So we're used to left to right, but
a lot of languages go right to left.

2005
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:56,240
So and kind of changes
the meaning of emoji.

2006
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:58,910
For example, right to
left, I send this a lot

2007
01:34:58,910 --> 01:35:03,800
to my friends when I'm going flying
from the Bay Area to New York.

2008
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:07,980
If you do it from left to right,
however, that is what it looks like.

2009
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:10,940
So it looks like you're in a
Bay Area but the plane is still

2010
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:13,980
going that kind of up and to the right.

2011
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:17,360
And then now it looks like you're
going from New York to the Bay Area.

2012
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:21,290
The other place is like, oh, it's a
girl, and she's running really fast.

2013
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:22,250
Right.

2014
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:26,255
That is right to left in our
world, wait left to right, sorry.

2015
01:35:26,255 --> 01:35:28,130
Sorry, that was supposed
to be left to right.

2016
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:32,400
And in here it would be she's like
behind like pollution or something

2017
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:32,900
like that.

2018
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:34,100
So sorry about--

2019
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:36,170
So an example, this is
actually in the proposal.

2020
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:38,690
Like in one case, if it's
left or right, you're

2021
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:40,340
running away from a line of cars.

2022
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:43,820
And the other one, it's a warning
to not run behind car fumes.

2023
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:48,860
So they are trying to figure out, how
do we mirror a bunch of the emoji.

2024
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:53,680
But the main thing that I think sort of,
I don't know when it's going to happen,

2025
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:55,430
I'm really hopeful
it's going to happen is

2026
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:59,090
trying to come up with a system that
supports little stickers in line that

2027
01:35:59,090 --> 01:36:01,610
don't need Unicode.

2028
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:06,920
So this is like Slack or on Twitch,
you can embed little pictures in line,

2029
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,768
and all the vendors have to get
together and agree to come up

2030
01:36:10,768 --> 01:36:12,060
with a standard way to do that.

2031
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:15,410
They'd have not yet come up with that,
but that is sort of one of the ways

2032
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:18,230
that Unicode is like
it wants to back away

2033
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:20,810
from actually being
like a global regulator

2034
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:22,910
for like little colorful glyphs.

2035
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:27,560
And so if you ever need to
reach me in my emoji world,

2036
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:30,560
you can find me jenny@emojination.org.

2037
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:35,930
There will be-- it will be actually
a while I think before we see

2038
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:38,057
a next generation of emoji showing up.

2039
01:36:38,057 --> 01:36:40,640
It used to be like every year,
they would get new code points.

2040
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,515
It might be a little
bit less than every year

2041
01:36:42,515 --> 01:36:47,180
now as they work on things
like directionality over time.

2042
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:49,740
If anyone has questions,
you can ask questions.

2043
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:50,930
You can find me afterwards.

2044
01:36:50,930 --> 01:37:00,257
I think I feel like there's supposed
to be some hubbub right now about maybe

2045
01:37:00,257 --> 01:37:01,340
microphones but maybe not.

2046
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:02,460
But maybe I'm just done.

2047
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:06,200
And if there are questions or
if David is around, I'm happy.

2048
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:09,200
I'm happy to have to answer
any questions that folks have.

2049
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:10,668
Yes?

2050
01:37:10,668 --> 01:37:11,210
AUDIENCE: Hi.

2051
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:12,160
Yes.

2052
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:15,604
I was wondering what were your
thoughts on The Emoji Movie.

2053
01:37:15,604 --> 01:37:16,104
JENNIFER 8.

2054
01:37:16,104 --> 01:37:18,870
LEE: So the question is, what are
my thoughts on The Emoji Movie.

2055
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:20,970
You're talking about
the Sony animated one?

2056
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:22,320
Yes.

2057
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:27,867
My thought on that is it is better
than a 6% rating on Rotten Tomatoes

2058
01:37:27,867 --> 01:37:28,950
would lead you to believe.

2059
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:30,090
So that's my one thought.

2060
01:37:30,090 --> 01:37:36,030
And my next thought is that was a rush
job from an animation perspective.

2061
01:37:36,030 --> 01:37:41,880
That was about 18 months,
whereas a typical animated movie

2062
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:43,000
takes four years.

2063
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,960
So in my spare time, I also
produce movies and documentaries.

2064
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:52,545
So one thing that is key to know
about movies and animated movies,

2065
01:37:52,545 --> 01:37:53,670
and this is very important.

2066
01:37:53,670 --> 01:37:57,330
They take a very long time,
but you can always fix it,

2067
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:59,430
because you haven't shot anything.

2068
01:37:59,430 --> 01:38:02,917
And a very good example of that is
I assume you guys have seen Frozen.

2069
01:38:02,917 --> 01:38:06,000
If you haven't seen-- you seem of the
age that you would have seen Frozen.

2070
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,080
I do not understand how
huge and a phenomenon or why

2071
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:11,400
was such a huge phenomenon.

2072
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:18,480
But they actually did an
original cut of Frozen and it--

2073
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:21,600
So I don't know if you guys
know the Snow Queen thing,

2074
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:26,490
but she's like super dark and not fun
and kind of evil and not someone you

2075
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:28,080
want to get behind as a character.

2076
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:31,930
So they actually did sort of
a rough cut of that of Frozen.

2077
01:38:31,930 --> 01:38:35,220
And they came out of that
with, it is just storyboarding.

2078
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:36,870
They're like, that is not good.

2079
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:38,430
And they killed it.

2080
01:38:38,430 --> 01:38:41,670
So they were like, we
can't go with this and then

2081
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:45,880
started from scratch more or
less again, starting with a song.

2082
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:48,180
"Let it Go," which is
actually written by a kid

2083
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:52,410
from my elementary school, Bobby
Lopez, or co-written by Bobby Lopez.

2084
01:38:52,410 --> 01:38:54,440
I also-- actually fun
fact, I also went, I

2085
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:57,332
would take the school bus
with a Lin-Manuel Miranda.

2086
01:38:57,332 --> 01:38:59,790
So I was a fourth grader when
he was like a kindergartener.

2087
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:02,520
So we had a very musical
elementary school in New York City.

2088
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:06,030
But the thing is, they could fix
it because they had enough time

2089
01:39:06,030 --> 01:39:08,490
and have enough money,
not like movies where

2090
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:11,080
you shoot humans, much harder to fix.

2091
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:13,830
You have the footage that you have,
and you can do little pickups,

2092
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:14,890
but you can't fix it.

2093
01:39:14,890 --> 01:39:18,750
So essentially what happened in
that case, I think it's 18 months,

2094
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:20,400
and it could have gotten better.

2095
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:23,310
And a lot of the movies that you
see with Pixar, like it's very--

2096
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:26,820
it's actually sort of emotionally
similar to the movie called Inside Out.

2097
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:28,800
.

2098
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,990
They just had more time,
and so it's better, so

2099
01:39:30,990 --> 01:39:35,700
as opposed to 18 months which is not
long enough to make an animated movie.

2100
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:41,040
But the other fun thing is, it was so
weird because they sold sponsorships.

2101
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:46,590
It was like, oh my God, here
comes the bots and the malware.

2102
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:50,020
Let's go into Dropbox
and protect ourselves.

2103
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:55,230
And so I think that it got
a lot of bad kind of vibes

2104
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:57,340
from the press for
doing things like that.

2105
01:39:57,340 --> 01:40:00,070
But from a kid's perspective, it's fine.

2106
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:01,260
I think if--

2107
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:05,550
I don't know that I would put it
on my top 10 of animated pictures,

2108
01:40:05,550 --> 01:40:08,310
but it's better than
6% on Rotten Tomatoes.

2109
01:40:08,310 --> 01:40:11,340
And then actually if you guys
ever care, we have done--

2110
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:15,210
I did a documentary about
emoji so and all the people

2111
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:16,710
that helped create emoji.

2112
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:22,975
And we did a CS50x movie night,
I think during the pandemic?

2113
01:40:22,975 --> 01:40:24,100
Was it during the pandemic?

2114
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:25,440
Everything is sort of
like blurred together,

2115
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:26,732
but it was during the pandemic.

2116
01:40:26,732 --> 01:40:28,440
Yeah.

2117
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,910
More questions?

2118
01:40:29,910 --> 01:40:30,750
Yes?

2119
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:31,716
AUDIENCE: Hi.

2120
01:40:31,716 --> 01:40:36,510
I wanted to know that you mentioned
that one of the criteria for having

2121
01:40:36,510 --> 01:40:38,820
an emoji accepted is that it's popular.

2122
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:40,380
How do determine whether--

2123
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:40,880
JENNIFER 8.

2124
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:41,960
LEE: Where there's demand, yeah.

2125
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:43,346
AUDIENCE: Whether there's demand.

2126
01:40:43,346 --> 01:40:44,270
How do you determine demand?

2127
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:45,200
Is it based on whether
or not [INAUDIBLE]??

2128
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:45,310
JENNIFER 8.

2129
01:40:45,310 --> 01:40:46,935
LEE: Yeah, that's a very good question.

2130
01:40:46,935 --> 01:40:49,260
Yeah, so the question is
one of the proposals--

2131
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:53,660
One of our criteria is of
getting an emoji accepted

2132
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:57,300
is to try to demonstrate demand
and how do we demonstrate demand?

2133
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:02,370
And I would say in a pretty
clumsy way actually at this point.

2134
01:41:02,370 --> 01:41:06,980
So the main thing that you have
in our current proposal process

2135
01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:09,920
is we have a median
emoji, which is elephant.

2136
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,853
So elephant is like, you stack
ranked all the emoji for popularity,

2137
01:41:12,853 --> 01:41:15,020
elephant is like [CLICKS]
right there in the middle.

2138
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:16,940
And it's also a concept
that's universally

2139
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:19,220
understood across all languages.

2140
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:24,650
So elephant shows up somewhere
between 500 million and 700 million

2141
01:41:24,650 --> 01:41:28,290
in Google search results, like
if you type it into a laptop,

2142
01:41:28,290 --> 01:41:32,150
you'll see elephant, 500
million search results.

2143
01:41:32,150 --> 01:41:37,880
And generally, you're trying to-- when
you're comparing your term to elephant,

2144
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:41,780
you want to see very roughly how many
Google search results, Bing search

2145
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:43,310
results, sometimes Instagram.

2146
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:45,950
So actually something that
was really surprising to me

2147
01:41:45,950 --> 01:41:47,660
was someone proposed hummingbird.

2148
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:53,330
I think hummingbird is a good proposal.

2149
01:41:53,330 --> 01:41:56,840
But if you look at hummingbird,
it's only like 21 million

2150
01:41:56,840 --> 01:42:00,320
in terms of the stats, so which I
thought was like very surprisingly low.

2151
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:05,330
So that's one of the main ways that
we kind of see like, is it also

2152
01:42:05,330 --> 01:42:07,650
visually used and all of that.

2153
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:08,900
Yeah.

2154
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:11,350
Any other questions?

2155
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:12,610
Are we good?

2156
01:42:12,610 --> 01:42:14,350
I didn't even need my water or anything.

2157
01:42:14,350 --> 01:42:15,760
Oh, can-- I'm going to take a picture.

2158
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:18,010
I'm going to take a picture for
because now you guys are actually

2159
01:42:18,010 --> 01:42:20,930
human and not Muppets, so I'm
very, very excited about this.

2160
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:24,250
So I will send this to my
block mates and be like, I just

2161
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:27,365
lectured at CS50 in Sanders Theatre.

2162
01:42:27,365 --> 01:42:28,990
DAVID J. MALAN: My thanks to Jenny Lee.

2163
01:42:28,990 --> 01:42:29,950
[APPLAUSE]

2164
01:42:29,950 --> 01:42:32,505
Thank you.

2165
01:42:32,505 --> 01:42:34,130
Yeah, you can stay up here if you want.

2166
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:34,922
Give me one second.

2167
01:42:34,922 --> 01:42:40,940


2168
01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:44,710
So if up until now, thought it
would be appropriate to toss this up

2169
01:42:44,710 --> 01:42:45,400
on the board.

2170
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:48,538
If up until now, you've not yet gotten
CS50 stress ball on the way out,

2171
01:42:48,538 --> 01:42:49,330
please do grab one.

2172
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:51,400
We got some extras as
well off to the side.

2173
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:54,340
But I would also keep
in mind, back in week 0,

2174
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:57,940
where again we began, we asked
you to categorize yourselves

2175
01:42:57,940 --> 01:43:01,360
as to whether you are among those less
comfortable, those more comfortable,

2176
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,160
or those somewhere in between.

2177
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:07,360
Please know now that you
are officially all some--

2178
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:10,955
Please know now that you were all
officially among those more comfortable

2179
01:43:10,955 --> 01:43:13,330
and indeed even though a couple
of more milestones await,

2180
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:16,960
we cannot wait to see what you
accomplish with your final projects.

2181
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:22,630
In the meantime, as always
this is and now this was CS50.

2182
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:26,008
[APPLAUSE]

2183
01:43:26,008 --> 01:43:47,207


2184
01:43:47,207 --> 01:43:50,165
[HARMONICA]

2185
01:43:50,165 --> 01:43:55,430
ALL: (SINGING) Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,

2186
01:43:55,430 --> 01:43:58,190
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

2187
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:03,510
Mr. Sandman, when I enrolled in CS50.

2188
01:44:03,510 --> 01:44:08,970
I'll say, truth be told, I
thought I'd be a real coding hero,

2189
01:44:08,970 --> 01:44:13,410
because I did so well on p-set 07.

2190
01:44:13,410 --> 01:44:15,480
It picked up so fast.

2191
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:18,630
Turns out the C is harder than scratch.

2192
01:44:18,630 --> 01:44:24,720
Hello, world and goodbye
sleep because this is CS50.

2193
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:27,270
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum bum,

2194
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:31,560
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

2195
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:35,470
Mr. Sandman, I was on
the [? fall grind, ?]

2196
01:44:35,470 --> 01:44:42,040
trying so hard to not fall behind,
attending section and wanting a tutor,

2197
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:45,320
stuck in the entry point of my computer.

2198
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:48,240
Sandman, finally getting ahead.

2199
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:51,520
They would switch us to Python instead.

2200
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:57,280
Why we spend five weeks
on C because this is CS50.

2201
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:01,690
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,

2202
01:45:01,690 --> 01:45:04,210
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

2203
01:45:04,210 --> 01:45:08,080
Mr. Sandman, we completed each task.

2204
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:11,290
JavaScript SQL, CSS and Flask.

2205
01:45:11,290 --> 01:45:14,440
With every language,
our minds had to reset.

2206
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:17,578
Don't get us started
on that finance p-set.

2207
01:45:17,578 --> 01:45:20,770
Sandman, now I return.

2208
01:45:20,770 --> 01:45:23,890
My friends asked if I would do it again.

2209
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:28,350
I replied, obviously,
because this was CS,

2210
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:35,290
no more p-sets because this was CS-fif
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,

2211
01:45:35,290 --> 01:45:36,620
bum, bum, T.

2212
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:37,820
[APPLAUSE]

2213
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:43,520


2214
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:46,270
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2215
01:45:46,270 --> 01:46:21,000
